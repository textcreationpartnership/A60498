            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Subjects here treated on are ſome of the weightieſt and moſt conſiderable in all Practical Divinity; and being Matters of the greateſt Importance to a good Life, and conſequently to our future Everlaſting Welfare; were therefore induſtriouſly handled with all imaginable Plainneſs and Perſpicuity, that Perſons of all Ranks and Qualities being nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb facs="tcp:37273:4"/> in them, they might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly lye Level to the Capacities of all men.</p>
            <p>The Author is not Ignorant that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral excellent Treatiſes of this Nature have been tranſmitted into publick View and Conſideration, which though he has not the Vanity to think he has excell'd, yet he hopes this further Help to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not be without its proper <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>The Compoſer of theſe Devotions is indeed conſcious of his inability to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Expectations of a nicely Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reader; but however he had much rather expoſe himſelf to the Cenſures of the Over-curious, than fail of promoting in the leaſt the Piety and Devotion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruly Religious and well-diſpoſed People: To ſuch he Writes, who having a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcerning of Spiritual things, theſe Spiritual Exerciſes of Prayer and Holy Meditation, are the likelieſt
<pb facs="tcp:37273:4"/> to prove Reliſhing and Acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
            <p>Devout and Pious Meditation is that which at once Delights and Profits, Recreates and improves in Goodneſs; rendering the Mind by degrees of a Godlike Celeſtial Temper: It ennobles the faculties of our Souls, by making them converſant about truly Great and Noble Objects; things Spiritual, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Heavenly! It withdraws us from the Noiſe and Tumult, exempts us from the Cares, Fears, Troubles and Vexations of this Lower World, and cauſing us to dwell much in our thoughts and deſires Above, it makes our Spirits too Big and Haughty, too Nice and Delicate for any impure ſublanary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; nay, of ſuch an Indifferency of Affection even to this Worlds Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Allowable Gratifications, as that no Loſs or Detriment which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them, no imaginary Excellency which is in them, is able to Excite our
<pb facs="tcp:37273:5"/> Paſſions, to Diſcompoſe our Thoughts, to abate our Religious Diligence, to weaken our Faith, impair our Truſt, or ſo much as Cool our Love for God, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Celeſtial Happineſs.</p>
            <p>All other things Cloy and Satiate with their often Repeated uſe, but the more we exerciſe this moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Duty, devout Contemplation, the more ſhall we deſire to be ſtill exerciſed therein: Its Pleaſures will grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Hands, and we ſhall find no Senſual Entertainment half ſo Quick and Reliſhing; our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings will be hereby Enlarged and Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Wills Rightly Byaſſed and Inclined, our Affections Purified and Refined, and our whole Spiritual Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers Diſintangled from the Deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Profits and Delights of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Animal Life, and Refreſhed with new varieties of a lively proſpect into the Joys Celeſtial, which are Pure, Sincere, Holy, and Intellectual!</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:37273:5"/>
            <p>Let us then in frequent Solemn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation on the Divine moſt Amiable Perfections, (the very Life and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Angels) become more exact Repreſentations of the Divine Purity and Holineſs; Let us Spiritualize our Minds, Becalme our Paſſions, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Suppreſs our Appetites to all Earthly Pomps and Vanities, and then neither this World's Honours, Profits, or Pleaſures ſhall ſeduce and ſoften us, nor ſhall its Changes and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances Grieve and Diſquiet us; but being Exalted in our Devout Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Regions whither the Storms and Tempeſts of this Lower State never reach, we ſhall enjoy an undiſturbed Peace and Tranquillity, nay a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom Enraviſhment of Mind while Living; and when we Dye, ſhall go whither our Pious Thoughts, Holy Deſires, Zealous Endeavours, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers, and Grateful Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings went before to prepare us

               <head>Meditation I. On the Vanity, Vexation and Contempt of the World.</head>
               <p>THE World! How poor, and mean, and empty a thing! Thoſe ſure who underſtand it well, can never dote upon it; for how ſhould they dote on a Scene of Folly and Vanity, of ſickly periſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which wither in the uſe, and dye away in the Enjoyment? Nay
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37273:9"/> which ſoon turn into loathing and deteſtation; we growing weary of what we have long poſſeſt, and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating a frequently repeated pleaſure, tho' at firſt it was never ſo Reliſhing.</p>
               <p>The World! A place of perpetual Snares and Temptations to ſinful evil! A State of interchangeable Joys and Regrets of Mind! Of Felicity in ſhew and appearance only, and of Adverſity in ſolid Subſtance and Reality!</p>
               <p>The Vanity and unſatisfactorineſs of this World, and of all the things which are in it, is evident from our ſhifting and changing our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; one while addreſſing our ſelves to this object of Gratification, ſoon after to another: For had we found ſatisfaction in former pleaſures, what need of our removal and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to New ones? Certainly this deſultory change of pleaſure, this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Range from one Earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to another, even in thoſe who enjoy moſt of this World, ſhews that long enjoy'd pleaſures tire, and cloy,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37273:9"/> and nauſeate, that none are truly great and ſatisfying, that all are vain and empty; that this our making freſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of ſublunary Happineſs, is like a ſick Man's turning himſelf from one ſide of his Bed to the other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indeed he demonſtrates his great uneaſineſs, but finds little or no Relief or Remedy: Vanity is an inſeparable ingredient in the compoſition of all Earthly Good things, to prevent the vanity of our Affections in inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately coveting and doteing upon them.</p>
               <p>Alaſs 'tis Fancy and high-rais'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſets a value upon things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, more than any Intrinſick real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency which is in them: We are fain to make up in gay and pleaſing Imagination, what is wanting of ſolid worth and beauty in Worldly Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and this way to put a Deceit upon our ſelves, thereby to hide the Deceit and Vanity of the Creature.</p>
               <p>Our deſires are too wide and large for their preſent Gratifications; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37273:10"/> though we frame to our ſelves glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conceptions of pleaſure at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, could we arrive to ſuch or ſuch a wiſh'd for Condition, yet our actual Enjoyment of the ſame evidences our too great opinion of it in remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and our opinion of it decaying, we afterwards become as weary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as before we were eager in its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men ſure muſt have little narrow Souls, muſt have experienc'd and made proof of little, muſt have thought and conſider'd leſs, who can make to themſelves a Portion and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency out of what they poſſeſs here; who can find any full and laſting Contentment in the things of this World.</p>
               <p>For what is our Life, but a tireſome Circulation of mean and trivial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments? But the living in a Round of Vanity and Impertinency, of Sins and vicious Miſcarriages? A Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame dull unſavoury enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; therefore unſavoury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37273:10"/> the ſame, and often Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Nay we do not only live a conſtant Return and Circle of Vanity, but of vexation of Spirit alſo; for diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from the vanity and vexation, from the diſappointment of the Creature.</p>
               <p>What variety of Sports and Paſtimes, of Pleaſures and Recreations do men invent and make uſe of to cauſe a weariſome uneaſie life to ſlide away the more ſmoothly and undiſturbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Hereby deceiving time, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting for the preſent their former miſery and trouble by means of the ſhort Intervals of forced and artificial Divertiſements: We are fain to gild over the bitter pill of Life with delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom forethoughts of future Temporal Felicity, to make it the eaſier ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd down at preſent, and the leſs ungrateful unto our Palates.</p>
               <p>Our Enjoyments here below are ſeldom pure and unmixt with Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the very beſt of them have an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37273:11"/> Allay, and to Enjoy with us is only not to be ſo much Afflicted: If we have one ſerene Sunſhiny Day with reſpect to our Minds or our Bodies, a ſucceeding lowry and ſtormy Seaſon comes next to daſh our Mirth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our Rejoycing; nay, our Cup of Sweets is uſually at the inſtant of drinking it mingled with Bitters, at leaſt the Conſideration of a Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood draught ſoon following after is enough to diminiſh much of its preſent ſweetneſs and good Reliſh.</p>
               <p>The Pains and Diſeaſes, the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Calamities of this Earthly Condition do in abundance of Men ſhare the greateſt part of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here, do in moſt perſons equal and come up unto, if not exceed and overballance their Enjoyments; ſo that with them, Being and Miſery, Subſiſtence and Sorrow, are but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Names for one and the ſame thing: And conſidering the large intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Affliction and Sorrow in this Valley of Tears, it would not be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37273:11"/> worth our while to lengthen out our Lives on Earth, were not this life principally in order to another, were it not a ſpace of Time wherein to fit and prepare our ſelves for an endleſs Eternity.</p>
               <p>O the Deceitfulneſs of Pomp, of Honour, of Riches, and worldly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, thoſe miſ-named Felicities! Height and Grandeur of Station, what is it but a gilded burthen, but a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did encumbrance? A Condition of wakeful Cares, and threatning Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The uſual Object of Envy, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Deſire, and malicious Cenſure while enjoy'd, and which leaves a man deſpiſed, reviled, and hated when fallen from its Elevation! A ſtate 'tis of living in continual noiſe and ſtir, of being ſubject to the urgency of Buſineſs, and tediouſneſs of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; of having little time and leiſure to our ſelves, little privacy and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Company, but being ſlaves and bondſmen to continual Attendants, to ſupplicating crowds and throngs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37273:12"/> of Addreſſers, to baſe fawning Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Paraſites; all the while we ſeem the moſt Free, the moſt Great, and Abſolute over others!</p>
               <p>Next, What is Fame and Honour, but popular ſound and breath? A thing ſo Thin and Airy, that he muſt have a very <hi>Camelion-</hi>like Temper and Appetite, who can live upon ſuch poor Diet with any great degree of Joy and Complacency; what is it but a puff of Wind and Vain-glorious Applauſe from the mouths of Mortals, as fickle and inconſtant as the Wind it ſelf? Honour and Praiſe, a gaudy Flower it is, often nipt by the Froſts and blights of Emulation, Hatred and Detraction; a thing whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies rather in the Perſon Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in him who is Honoured; what no one ought to value himſelf upon as 'tis conferr'd on him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as 'tis merited by himſelf; that which makes a man no better poſſeſt of it, nor no worſe when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37273:12"/>
               <p>Riches; What are they but an heap of bright and ſhining Clay? Which oppreſſeth with Troubles, while it ſhould eaſe and recreate; and uſually bends and weighs down the Soul with Covetouſneſs to the Earth: Riches what are they but vaniſhing Treaſures? Which if not taken out of our Hands by the Fraud, Violence, and Injuſtice of others, may in time make themſelves Wings and fly away from us; which we certainly muſt leave at the day and hour of our Death. Riches attended with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting thoughts, and brain-cracking Projects in the procuring them, with anxious Cares and Solicitudes in the keeping them, with jealous fears and diſtruſts of looſing or being deſpoil'd of them: The immoderate Love of which is the Root of all evil. That which puts men upon the worſt of wicked practices, which pierces their Hearts through with many Sorrows, and finally drowns them in the Gulph of Perdition.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:37273:13"/>
               <p>Worldly Pleaſures what be they? But the joyous ſenſations of a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Deceaſe as ſoon almoſt as born; and which taſted ſtraightway looſe their flavour and Reliſh: Which if diſhoneſt and ſinful are likewiſe hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prejudicial, and very ſeverely paid for by ſucceeding ſhame, ſorrow and repentance; if innocent and harmleſs, yet carrying vanity in their Nature; they add alſo Vexation of Spirit, through a deceit of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: For how ſhould what is Finite, as all Terrene Comforts are, afford any compleat and ſettled Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Oh no; Abſolute and Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Contentment is not contain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow limits of the Creature. Nothing but what is Infinite is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to an immortal Souls Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are next to Infinite!</p>
               <p>O our God, that ſuch a thing of Nothing, or worſe than Nothing, of pain, ſorrow, and diſappointment, as is this World, ſhould take up ſo much of our Affections as it does;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37273:13"/> and that Heaven, a Region of the ſublimeſt, ſincereſt, ever-durable, and moſt enraviſhing Delights, ſhould ſhare ſo little in our Love and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation! Thither, did we mount our Thoughts, our Deſires, our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enterprizes, even to the Celeſtial Manſions above, oh with what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſhould we look down on this vile inferiour Earth! How little would it appear in our ſight! Nay, how would it in a manner diſappear; our God, our Heaven, our ſpiritual and eternal Concerns having pre-ingaged the main of our Affections, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently having left little Room for meaner Objects and Entertainments!</p>
               <p>We are Pilgrims here on Earth, and therefore ought to have the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indifferency of Pilgrims to its moſt entertaining Gratifications; we are ſtrangers here on Earth, and ought on that account to be ſhy of uſing too much Familiarity with the World, leſt it ſhould ruin and betray us with its wicked Seductions: For
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37273:14"/> who would truſt himſelf too far, who would live careleſs and unguarded in a Forreign, in an Enemies Country? We are Strangers here; 'tis ſo very Little a time we ſhall continue in this Alien Countrey, that 'tis not worth our while to ſet our hearts upon it, to learn its Language, or Conform our ſelves to its Cuſtoms and Manners.</p>
               <p>We are Citizens of the <hi>New-Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which is above, Heirs of an Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ſhall we baſely hanker after the Garlick and Onions of this viler <hi>Egypt?</hi> Can we think this howling Wilderneſs-Condition a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of Delights? Or do we account Heaven the End of our Hopes, not worth making it the End of our Pious Labours? Not worth the looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or earneſt contending for it?</p>
               <p>Does a life of Voluptuouſneſs, of too free indulgence unto, or too much Affection for Worldly Pleaſure, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or Profit, ſuit with the Goſpel-Duties of Mortification and Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? With a being Crucified to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37273:14"/> World, and the World to us in the immoderate Love thereof? With the End of our being ſent into it, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare for our happy going out of it, and for a Bleſſed Eternity? Does it ſuit to our profeſſion of a Suffering Religion, ſuit to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of a Crucified Saviour? To his Mortified, Poor, and Lowly Example? Who was made perfect through Sufferings and Worldly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations: Does it ſuit laſtly to our Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant, wherein we ſolemnly engaged to Renounce the Devil and all his Works, the vain Pomp and Glory of the World, with all covetous deſires of the ſame, and no longer to follow or be led by them? O what Perfidiouſneſs, what Perjury is it after all this to be falſe to our Chriſtian Profeſſion, falſe to our Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant, by becoming Idolaters of Earthly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, following and being led by it; and preferring the things Sublunary,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37273:15"/> before thoſe of Heaven and Eternal Glory!</p>

               <head>Meditation II. On the Redemption of Time.</head>
               <p>THere is no Talent committed to our Truſt more precious than Time, it being a ſeaſon for the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion for an Happy Eternity, and yet no Truſt is there more abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, more profuſely ſquander'd away. We take Time by the Fore-lock in all our Temporal Concerns, laying hold on the firſt opportunity of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managing them; but in Spirituals we defer and delay, and move ſo heavily about the good husbanding of Time, as if the wheels of our Chariots, of our Executive Powers, our Wills and Affections were taken off; and Time was rather to be ſhunn'd and avoided than diligently purſued.</p>
               <p>But is This running the Race of Chriſtian Obedience ſet before us? Is This giving all diligence to make
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37273:17"/> our Calling and Election Sure? Is This Redeeming the Time, becauſe the days are Evil? Time lies ſo dead a Commodity on many Peoples hands, that they are glad to get rid of it at any rate whatſoever. The next vain pleaſure and divertiſement, the next as vain and impertinent Idle-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the next fruitleſs, ſilly, or corrupting Spectacle, ſhall eaſe them of their ſpare hours as they call 'em, of their leiſure and weariſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But ah that any time ſhould be accounted ſpare and vacant, when ſo much as our Eternal Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it, and we know not whether we ſhall Live till the next Moment! Ah that what is the dying Man's Want, ſhould be the well Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Burthen!</p>
               <p>While Living, Time is thought by us too Long and Tedious, we are hard put to it to ſpend many of its Hours, while Dying 'tis accounted too ſhort and Tranſient; which now is likely to be the trueſt Judgment, that of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37273:17"/> living or dying man? For certain that of the Latter: For at the near approaches of Death all falſe diſguiſes which the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, or the Pride of Life had put on things, are pull'd off, and then all things appear in their proper Colours, and Genuine Native Dreſs.</p>
               <p>When Death Stares us in the face, when Time is nigh at an End with us, then we ſhall know the true value of Time, then to our coſt and trouble have far different Sentiments concerning it, than what we have Now; then, oh that Time could be Recall'd, that Time miſ-ſpent could be lived over-again, and be better improved; how diligent and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious would we be in its improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! But alaſs theſe Good Wiſhes come then too late to be converted into Good Practices; Death will not be put off, Time will not be Recall'd, and the Man dies deſpairingly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, if not everlaſtingly Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37273:18"/> not for that he had no means of Grace, no opportunities of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but becauſe he made not that Good Uſe of them as he both might and ought to have done.</p>
               <p>Time paſſes away ſwiftly, though we idle and loiter; the Minutes, the precious Minutes fly, while we are ſpeaking; we are Now a Moment nearer Eternity, than we were the former one: but are we in a nearer preparation for it? Is there a nearer Tendency in us to an Heavenly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the nigher we come to the Heavenly State? Or rather grow we not more Earthly Affection'd, the nigher we draw to our bed of Earth the Grave?</p>
               <p>Alaſs the Loſs of Time is one of the Greateſt Loſſes in the World, and yet how Light a matter do we make of it? This Life ſo ſhort, ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, every Moment of it ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet that we ſhould live as if it were never to have an End, or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37273:18"/> as if we had nothing of Concern to do in it; How Aſtoniſhing is this, what an Inſtance of Folly and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs!</p>
               <p>Bleſſed God! That a Pearl of ſo Great price as an indulged ſpace of Repentance, as an happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Salvation, ſhould be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swine, before brutiſh ſenſual Worldlings; ſhould be put into the Cuſtody of thoſe who value it not, who know not how to uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it!</p>
               <p>The Days, the Months, the years of our Lives are violently born away by the impetuous Torrent of Time; many, many Days of our Years are paſt and Gone as to our ever living them over again; but though paſt, yet are they not wholly loſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd: They are Regiſtred in God's Faithful Book of Remembrance; they are there preſerved, they are there charged upon us for a demand of their Good Uſe and Husbandry; an Account, an Account of them will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37273:19"/> one day be required at our Hands: And it will be but a lamentable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count indeed, when all we have to offer for the expence of our Life paſt will be ſo much Time ſpent Idly, and in doing of nothing to any Good purpoſe; ſo much ſpent to a very Bad one, in Riot and Exceſs, in Chambering and Wantonneſs; ſo much in unneceſſary Habitual Sports and Divertiſements; ſo much ſpent in the Devil's Service, and ſo little in God Almighty's! Ah will ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, think ye, paſs our Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's Examination? Will ſuch an Account procure our Diſcharge and Acquitment?</p>
               <p>What a ſtrange perverſe folly is it in us to complain our Life is ſhort, and yet to render it far ſhorter, by letting much of it lye Fallow and unimproved? To complain our day time here is quickly ſpent, and our Night of Death is near at hand, and yet to invent Arts to laviſh this ſhort Remainder of Life, and then to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37273:19"/> its being ſo ſoon paſt away and we are Gone? But if we would lengthen time, let us leave off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and fall to the work of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it; let us beſide the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Returns of Publick Religious Worſhip at ſet appointed Seaſons, be frequent and fervent in our private Domeſtick Devotions; let us allow to Religion and the exerciſes of Vertue, ſome of thoſe Great ſhares of Time which we call ſpare Hours; which we trifle away in vanities and impertinencies, in pleaſures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, in fruitleſs Viſits and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements; which we ſpend viciouſly in Luxury, Riot, and Intemperance, or which we ſuffer to lye waſte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Employment at all: 'Tis a vaſt work a man may do, if he never permits himſelf to be Idle; 'tis a huge progreſs he may make in Vertue, if he never ſtops in the way through Careleſneſs, or never goes out of his way by wilful and preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Strive to improve all your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37273:20"/> Time, ſtrive to ſuffer none of it to paſs unaccountable; and this will be to Redeem it, this will be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for its ſhortneſs, for its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and Irrevocableneſs.</p>
               <p>We cannot begin too ſoon to live well, and yet do we demur about it? Had we ſet upon the work of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion much earlier, we ſhould have had none to ſpare; all would have been little enough, whereby to have evidenced the ſincerity of our Faith, and Hope, and Truſt; of our Love to God and his Commandments; whereby to have ſecured an Intereſt in his Favour and Acceptance, and in his free Gift, Eternal Life: For Heaven cannot be over-purchaſed, we cannot do too much for ſuch a far more exceeding and endleſs weight of Glory; and the more we do in Holy Services, the Greater in all Likelihood will be our future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:37273:20"/>
               <p>By inſtantly beginning to live well we ſhall render the work the eaſier, ſhall be better diſpoſed to it our ſelves, and ſhall have leſs to Repent of and Reform; but the longer we delay Redeeming our time, the Greater and more Difficult underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhall we find it when we ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: Every man has his Religious Task appointed him at his coming into this World, to diſcharge before his Going out of it; and each day has its peculiar Godly work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs aſſign'd it; wherefore if we imprudently omit the proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this day, we ſhall have ſo much the more to do to morrow; both this days Religious work, and to morrow's alſo: Since then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto its own day is the vertuous Task thereof, let us not through our preſent Omiſſions double and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our future pious Pains and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; encreaſe by delays of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Time, our work of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diminiſh at the ſame inſtant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37273:21"/> our ſtrength and ability to perform it with: So much Time as we have loſt in the neglect of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo much have we loſt of our increaſe of future Happineſs, and of our weight of Eternal Glory; and can we be content to looſe yet more of it? Can we be content through our miſpence of Time to hazard the whole of Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs?</p>
               <p>Time preſent is our only ſtate of Trial and Probation; the After-Life determines our Condition to either Everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery; and therefore we ought to improve to the utmoſt inſtant Opportunities, and to work out our Salvation to Day, while 'tis call'd to Day: For our Religious Work is large and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; the putting off a whole Body of Sin, the putting on the whole Armour of Righteouſneſs; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing old evil habits, a contracting by the Grace of God in Conjunction with our Endeavours, new Vertuous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37273:21"/> habits; the improving them into a Second Nature, into a participation of the Divine Nature and Likeneſs: All this we have to do in the ſhort ſpace of our Mortality, in a Life but a Span long; and therefore ought to ſupply our Poverty of Time by its frugal Well-management, and by the Intenſeneſs of our Affections and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices God-ward: Making up in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Zeal, what we want in Time; and obeying God univerſally, chearfully, fervently and conſtantly unto the End.</p>
               <p>But oh the quite contrary Practice of the Generality of the World! who are forward to improve every thing but Time, which moſt of all requires improvement; who purſue eagerly every Advantage, but the Higheſt one, their Eternal Salvation: Ah doubtleſs he is unworthy of Eternal Life, who ſeeks it not diligently, as for hid Treaſure; who lives not to God and his own Soul: Certainly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37273:22"/> he is unworthy to win the Prize of Heavenly Glory, who runs ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, as if he matter'd not whether he obtain'd it or no! All that Time is but waſted, whereof no part is ſpent in the Concerns of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <head>Meditation III. On the Folly and Danger of deferring Repentance.</head>
               <p>TO delay preſent Repentance in hopes of future Converſion, is alike imprudent, as for a ſick Man to neglect the preſent uſe of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, in hopes of future Health and Recovery; whenas by his neglect of Remedies, he in all probability ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Diſtemper deſperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable!</p>
               <p>To delay Amendment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Sin, with intent of quitting it hereafter, is to wound our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with the ſtings and remorſes of Guilt, on purpoſe of healing them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37273:24"/> again ſome time hence: 'Tis to refuſe to do what is in our power, and to defer the doing it till it may be out of our power; 'tis to make our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture work of Repentance much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more grievous and difficult than it would be at preſent, and yet to hope to ſet about it more Advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in time to come: 'Tis to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Task, to leſſen both our Will and Ability to perform it with, and yet to think to perform it better under theſe Diſadvantages!</p>
               <p>To defer Converſion, is to perſiſt becoming vain in our Imaginations, erroneous in our Elections, corrupt in our Performances, that afterwards we may become Wiſe, and retract with Bitterneſs of Self-condemning thoughts, our former vain Judgments, wrong Choices, evil Practices; that we may upon change of Mind, Will, and Affections, call our ſelves fools a thouſand times for our former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked goings aſtray; and may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of, may abhor and grieve
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37273:25"/> for our paſt Impieties, as much as ever heretofore we loved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in them; all theſe Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Foilies Delay of Repentance implies! 'Tis a refuſing to become well, and ſafe, and happy at preſent, and a referring our ſpiritual Welfare, our everlaſting ſafety and happineſs to the hazardous uncertainties of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity!</p>
               <p>But do we act thus imprudently in other Affairs of far leſſer moment? No certainly; when Sick, we delay not the uſe of means for our Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when Maim'd or Wounded, we apply our ſelves immediately to a Cure; but when ſick with Sin nigh unto death Eternal, when wounded in Mind by the Rebukes of Guilt contracted, and maimed in all the Faculties of our Souls by the diſorders of Impiety, ſo that from the Crown of the head to the ſole of the feet there is no whole part in us; yet here we hug our Diſtemper, ſeem unwilling to be cured at preſent, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37273:25"/> defer the healing remedy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, till ſome further ſeaſon: but ah that we ſhould be ſo wiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in Temporals, and ſo careleſs and inconſiderate in Spirituals! Ah that we ſhould be ſo much concern'd for the Body, and ſo little for the Soul!</p>
               <p>Oh that men ſhould judge it too early to become inſtantly ſecure of endleſs Salvation; when they are not ſecure of living till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, till the next moment! Vain inadvertent Wretches! That they ſhould be daily a dying, hourly ſubject to Death, and yet promiſe themſelves ſome years hence the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure of Eternal Life! Certainly they know not what it means, of what value and importance it is, that they thus ſtupidly neglect it!</p>
               <p>Ah can they think God will leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then out that Life which is a deſign'd Courſe of Audacious Defiance and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37273:26"/> wicked Rebellion againſt him? Ah can they think he will ſo unwearied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait to be Gracious unto them? Alas they conſider not what Bonds and Fetters an Evil Cuſtom puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul; how frequent Acts of doing wickedly improve into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd habit, and an habit of Impiety becomes a ſecond Nature, almoſt unrelinquiſhable; and yet do they imagine they ſhall be freer to break looſe from Sin after a long-continued Bondage thereunto? That their Chains of Iniquity will be the eaſier ſhaken off, after they are Rivited by Cuſtom and Inveteracy of wicked Practice?</p>
               <p>Can we make too much haſte to be Saved? To get out of a ſtate lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Eternal Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, into a ſtate of Divine Grace and Favour? Are our Minds, Wills, and Affections likely to be ſofter, more melting and impreſſible with the ſorrows of Repentance, after
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37273:26"/> they are Harden'd through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of continued ſinning? Will God's Grace the more abound towards us, the more we abound in Tranſgreſſing againſt him? What Surety haſt thou, impenitent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer, but thy day of Grace may be ended before the day of thy Life? But that not Believing and Repenting at preſent, hereafter may be too Late? He that Believeth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth not (ſays our Saviour) is condemned Already. The Irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sentence may be Pronounc'd on thee here, though Executed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World.</p>
               <p>Repent Hereafter? Why, doſt thou conſider what Hereafter means? It imports the utmoſt Hazard and Uncertainty: In reckoning on Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, thou reckoneſt on a thing out of thine own Power, and only in God Almighty's Diſpoſal; for the Grace of Repentance (as all other Graces) is the Divine Gift; and He
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37273:27"/> who has promiſed pardon to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, has no where told us we can be penitent when we Pleaſe: On the contrary God has inform'd us, that 'tis his Spirit which works in us both to Will and to do of his Own Good pleaſure; and canſt thou think he will work it, though never ſo long Reſiſted in the endeavour? That his Divine Patience will never be tired, the Treaſures of his Long-ſuffering be never exhauſted?</p>
               <p>The Holy Scripture indeed tells us God waits to be Gracious, but how Long he waits we are not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; on the contrary it is written, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not Always ſtrive with man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ah there is a time when God leaves ſinners to themſelves, when they will not by any means be perſwaded to leave their ſins; There is a certain meaſure of God's Grace and of man's Impieties, after which the Holy Spirit withdraws himſelf, and will not any longer be entreated: And how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, perſevering Impenitent, but that if thou neglecteſt Grace and the ſeaſon thereof Now, the meaſure of thy ſins may hereafter be compleated, and both thy allowance of Grace, and the opportunity of making uſe of it, may be over with thee?

               <p>O Sin how common art thou, and yet how little underſtood! How Common, and therefore how little Dreaded and Abhorr'd! Did men conſider and underſtand thee more, they would ſure Love and Practice thee Leſs.</p>
               <p>Alaſs they conſider not thy direct oppoſition to God's Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Rectitude of Will, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Divine Eſſence; thy contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the Laws of Nature, of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of Grace: How thou art a Violation of God's Revealed Will and Pleaſure in the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37273:31"/> Writings which contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but precepts Holy, Juſt and Good; and which conſequently 'tis our greateſt Intereſt and Advantage, as well as Bounden-Duty to obſerve; and our greateſt Diſadvantage as well as Diſobedience to break and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>They conſider not, Sin, how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite thou art to their own Perſonal Welfare and Happineſs, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal; how Degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Defiling to their Souls and Conſciences; what an Ignominy and Reproach to our Underſtandings, what a Violence and Affront to our Reaſons, what a perverſion and wrong-byaſs of our Wills and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what a cauſe of Regret and Diſquietude of Mind to thoſe who voluntarily Commit thee; how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God, how injurious to Man, how prejudicial to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Order, Peace, and Proſperity of the Univerſe.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37273:31"/>
               <p>What an ungrateful Return thou art to the Divine Goodneſs, Patience, and Forbearance; how thou art an offering deſpite to the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Grieving, a Quenching, a total Driving it away from us; a Crucifying afreſh the bleſſed Son of God, a Treading him under foot, and accounting the Blood of the New-Covenant an unholy thing; a Rejection of all the Merciful Terms and offers of Goſpel-Reconciliation, a rendering the means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of begetting Grace in us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; a chooſing Death, Eternal Death, rather than Life, Eternal Life; a wilful Treaſuring up of Wrath againſt the day of Wrath and Revelation of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a provok'd offended Deity!</p>
               <p>All this, and much more, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of known voluntary Sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and can we be ſo irrational, ſo Vile, and Diſ-ingenuous, ſo even like Beaſts before God, as to continue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37273:32"/> practicing vicious Impurity with Greedineſs, after having thus weigh'd and conſider'd, how Evil, how bitter, and Lothſom a thing it is? Oh is there no knowledge, no underſtanding in the Workers of Impiety, is there no Shame, no Fear, no Regard in them to their Everlaſting Salvation, that they drink down Iniquity like Water, and Ruſh into the occaſions of their own Ruin, into the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all Wickedneſs, as the War-Horſe ruſheth into the Battle, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly and inconſiderately?</p>
               <p>Ah Vice, how ſtupifying a thing art thou! What a polluter firſt of our Souls and Conſciences, and after long Cuſtom of ſinning what a layer of them Aſleep? what an hardener of our hearts through thy continued and dayly advancing deceitfulneſs!</p>
               <p>Thou Wickedneſs art pleaſurable indeed in the Act, but alaſs how tranſient the Act, how vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable the pleaſure! whereas the after-Memory of thee is torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37273:32"/> and much more exquiſite, much more Durable a Pain, than thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Enjoyment was a Delight! Alas! How art thou all over Diſorder and Irregularity, Madneſs and Unreaſonableneſs, Shame and Diſgrace, Depravity and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! How doſt thou render the practicers of thee the Objects of God's curſe and hatred, who is otherwiſe the moſt kind and benign being; for God who is Love it ſelf, Love in the very Abſtract, does however infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely hate the Sinner, hates him even unto Death Eternal!</p>
               <p>O the Guilt, the inexpiable Guilt of ſin unrepented of, that nothing leſs than an Eternity of puniſhment is its Recompence; that it ſhall ever be Attoning for, and yet never be Attoned; that the precious blood of Jeſus, as infinitely ſatisfactory as it is, can yet never quench the infernal flames to which ſin unforſaken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes us!</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:37273:33"/>
               <p>Ah did men but thoroughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Evil Nature of Sin, the baſeneſs, the turpitude, the Diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Ingratitude thereof, the Greatneſs of that Everlaſting Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to which it renders Sinners obnoxious, the full import of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Damnation occaſioned through Neglect of ſo great Salvation as that the Goſpel offers us, no Temptation ſure would be big or prevalent enough to entice them to the wilful commiſſion of Impiety, but they would reject it with the ſame holy ſcorn and abhorrence, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did the impure ſollicitations of his <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Miſtreſs, crying out, How can we do this Great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God, our Heavenly Father? How can we do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt his Son our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's moſt plenteous and merciful Redemption? againſt the Holy Ghoſt our Sanctifier's moſt kind, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and often repeated Strivings with us to bring us to repentance?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37273:33"/> who (wou'd we ſuffer him to do it, did we not reſiſt him by ſinning) would ſeal, would Confirm and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us in Grace unto the Day of Redemption!</p>
               <p>'Tis obſervable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the odious and heinous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, knew not better what to call it than by its own filthy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Name, ſinful ſin; that Sin, ſays he, might appear ſin; and ſin by the Commandment appeared exceeding ſinful: Any other Name than its own had been too Good for it, any other than its own would have ſeemed to have Leſſen'd its evil Quality.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in the Creation Irregular and Deformed, but as Sin has defaced and brought a Curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; Sin the Reverſe to all that's Great and Good, Praiſe-worthy and Honourable; the bane and Diſorder of Univerſal Nature: That which turned Angels of Light and Glory into Angels of Darkneſs and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; changed their once happy and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37273:34"/> pure Beings into the unhappyneſs and impurity of Devils; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Mankind out of Paradiſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them at once out of a ſtate of Innocence and felicity: Sin, that which expoſed us to Sickneſs, Miſery, and Death Temporal of the Body, to Depravity of mind, Diſorderlyneſs of Appetites, perturbation of paſſions, and the Spiritual Eternal Death of the Soul!</p>
               <p>'Twas fatal impiety and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which turned a fruitful <hi>Eden</hi> into a barren Wilderneſs, turned the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God into a Seed-plot of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the Devil; Subjects the Creature unwillingly to bondage and Corruption, makes it Groan earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Deliverance, for the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Reſtitution of all things, when there ſhall be no more pain, Sorrow, Sickneſs, or Death; becauſe no more ſin the occaſion of them; no more Bodily Evil, becauſe no more mental and moral evil.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37273:34"/>
               <p>Sin, 'tis the great Malady and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Soul; the deſtruction of its health, beauty, vigour, and Safety; that which puts it into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural temper, puts all its powers and faculties out of order, renders it enflamed with violent paſſions, Sick with inordinate appetites, tortured with various and contrary deſires; and is it not madneſs to be in Love with ſuch our Diſeaſe? To hug and Retain ſo much Spiritual Sickneſs and infirmity?</p>
               <p>Sin is alſo the Death of the Soul; the Death of it to the Life of Grace and Vertue; the Death of it to the Quickning influences and Renewing Efficacy of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the Death of it to any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſenſe, and Grateful Reliſh of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Heavenly Good things; and is it not the higheſt imprudence to be Jocund and Merry amidſt a Dying condition? Nay to be Dead, actually Dead ſtupid, and benummed in Sins and treſpaſſes, and yet Alive, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37273:35"/> in, and well-pleaſed with ſuch our calamitous eſtate?</p>
               <p>Sin is likewiſe the moſt abject Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Soul, that which renders us the Servants of Corruption; a Slavery of it to impure luſts and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to Tyrannous evil cuſtoms and habits, to the over-ruling Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil, who leads wilful ſinners Captive at his pleaſure: And is it not folly to be Gratified and Contented with ſuch a Servile ſtate, with ſuch a baſe and loathſome Drudgery?</p>
               <p>Sin 'tis oppoſite to all God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes and Perfections; for if we conſider his Soveraignty of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Sin is Diſobedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; if his Wiſdom, 'tis Folly and Madneſs in contradicting it; if his Power, 'tis Impotency in vainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it; if God's Juſtice is reſpected, Sin is Iniquity; if his Goodneſs and Forbearance, 'tis Diſingenuity and Unthankfulneſs; if his Holyneſs and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37273:35"/> Purity, 'tis the Greateſt Pollution and Degeneracy; if his Truth and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, Sin is Falſehood and Error! So that Sin being contrary to the pure and holy Nature of God, which is the Original Pattern and Standard of all good; Sin conſequently muſt needs be the Top, the Abſtract and Epitome of all Evil: And ought ſuch a thing to be the Object of our Choice, of our Love and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of our practice and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Sin contains in it the very formal Nature of Hell and future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for what makes Hell? What but the Helliſh, that is, the wicked impure tempers and diſpoſitions of the wretches inhabiting it? which evil tempers of mind would prove their unhappy owners internal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſquietude, were there no External Lake of fire and brimſtone, of avenging flames and utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37273:36"/>
               <p>Nay Sin is not only the principal and conſtituent part of Hell, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a much worſe and far Greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil than Hell it ſelf; for Hell is Good for ſomething, to take vengeance on the finally impenitent and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and thereby to vindicate God's Juſtice and Holineſs, but ſin ſerves only to abuſe his Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Hell was of Gods making, Sin of the Devils: Nay Hell was made in pitty to Mankind, to deter them from coming into that place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but Sin offers violence to Hell, as if it were the ſeat of Happineſs; forces open the Gates of that Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fiery Furnace, dragging men into it much againſt the Will and Reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Endeavours of their Creator, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, Sanctifier and Redeemer!</p>
               <p>O Sin, where is thy profit? when as thy Loſs is that of our immortal Souls! that of Heaven, of peace of Mind, and Joys in the Holy-Ghoſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37273:36"/> unſpeakable and full of Glory! Where thy pleaſure? when-as thy Torment is that of a guilty diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience, that of continual dread of Divine Puniſhment, that of ſhort empty Delights, and after vexatious Reflections on them; that of an Afflictive ſenſe of having no Lot or Portion in the Love and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, an infinite Good!</p>
               <p>Sin muſt needs be the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the worſt of any thing which is Enemy to either God or Man; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis God's uſual method to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin with ſin, when all his other Reclaiming Eſſays of Providence have through the obſtinacy of the ſinner proved ineffectual; I will chuſe their deluſions, ſays God, and give them over to their Iniquities; he that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: As if to be a Sinner was miſery ſufficient; and no vengeance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37273:37"/> for Impiety like that of being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a continuance therein.</p>
               <p>The exceeding Great Malignity of Sin is in nothing more ſeen than in this, that it coſt God more to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the World than at firſt to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it; coſt him but the <hi>fiat</hi> of his Will, but a Word's ſpeaking to make it out of Nothing, but ſtood him at the invaluable Expence of his Son's Blood to Ranſom it out of worſe than Nothing, a polluted, ſinful, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undone Condition: At God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World there was only want and abſence of previous matter whereout to make it, no repugnant inaptitude, no contrariety in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereby in the leaſt to obſtruct or retard the Divine Efficacy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Redemption of the loſt World, there was the deep rooted Corruption of our Nature, invetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Evil Cuſtom and Habit, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Affection, and perverſeneſs of Man's Will to be conflicted with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37273:37"/> and overcome by God's Spirit, by his holy Word and Sacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ranſome purchaſed could be applyed, and made Savingly Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: So much more is there in Sin of inconquerableneſs and Difficulty of ſubjection than in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and miraculous material product of an Almighty power!</p>
               <p>O let but our thoughts carry us to the places of our Saviours bitter Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Sufferings, and there let us behold him greatly Amazed and ſore troubled, Sweating great drops of blood, bowing beneath the weight of his Fathers Diſpleaſure, crying out, Father if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; and at laſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on a painful and Ignominious Croſs thoſe extream torments both of body and mind; which the ſins of all Mankind had deſerved, which none but the Manhood in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Godhead could have undergone, and which were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Sufficient to Expiate the Guilt

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37273:41"/> us Temptations; then when he finds us moſt unguarded, then when he finds our hearts moſt light and vain, and conſequently moſt liable to entertain his Suggeſtions: He watches what ſinful Allurement is likelieſt to take Effect with us, by means of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what our General Temper of body moſt inclines us to, or what our occaſional diſpoſition of Mind renders us the moſt ſubject to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with; and he baits his hook with ſuch a Temptation as is moſt agreeable to our ſinful Inclination, which he hath aforehand diſcover'd, or at leaſt ſhrewdly Gheſt at; and therefore it nearly concerns us to Guard our ſelves againſt him with Watchfulneſs; to keep us from thoſe ſins we are moſt inclinable to, that they gain not the Dominion over us; to keep us from Conſtitutional Sins, to which our Tempers byaſs us; from thoſe of frequent occurrence, from ſins of Infirmity, which being Leſſer ones, are on that account leſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37273:41"/> Obſervable and Dreaded, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more Dangerous; to be very careful to avoid the Occaſions of ſinning, the pre-diſpoſitions, means and opportunities leading thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; to ſhun the very ſhews and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Evil: In ſhort, to watch againſt all Sin and Temptation in General.</p>
               <p>There is no Condition of life free from its Enticements to ſinning; they are apt to intermingle themſelves with whatever we Think, Speak or Act: Wealth and Proſperity is a dangerous Temptation to the ſinful Abuſe of Divine Bleſſings into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Wantonneſs, into Pride and Careleſneſs, into Forgetfulneſs of God and our Duty owing to him; and Want and Adverſity is a ſtrong (tho' undue) Provocative to Diſtruſt and Diffidence of God's Goodneſs &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding Care over us, is an Incitement to Murmuring, Impatience and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with his Providential Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations: So that in every ſtate we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37273:42"/> are Unſafe and Inſecure in every thing Sin lies at the door to ſurprize and Aſſault us; its Snares are ſpread for us every where, though we are inſenſible of them, though perhaps for the preſent they have not in any Groſs inſtance Caught and Entangled us: and when we live thus among vicious Baits and Dangers, always Near, always Expos'd to 'em, ought we not to be extream wary and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant?</p>
               <p>Alaſs, the Partition Line between Lawful and Unlawful is ſo ſmall and narrow, that the paſſage from one to the other is but a Step, or rather (if we advert not) a ſudden and eaſie Slip; The utmoſt Freedom in things Allowable, is a Bordering on the confines of Diſallowable; nay, not only a Bordering upon what's prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, but alſo an hazardous Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereunto: We muſt not come Nigh a Peſt-houſe, if we would not be infected with its Contagion.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:37273:42"/>
               <p>Temptation is indeed the Subject-Matter and Exerciſe of Vertue; ſo far from Moral Evil in it ſelf, that 'tis the Tryal and Improvement of our Graces; the Tryal of an honeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart, of our ſincere Love to God and Goodneſs, of our reſolved Conſtancy in the ways of Holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: But however 'tis a perilous proof of our Vertue; and better be without the Proof, than without our Innocency; better be out of the reach of Temptation, than by coming in its way, endanger our being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd therewith. Yet ſince we can never be wholely out of the Reach of Temptation, at leaſt out of a Liableneſs thereunto, good Reaſon have we to be continually watchful and circumſpect over our Hearts and our Behaviour, that ſin through its Deceitfulneſs Gain not upon us.</p>
               <p>For Satan's wicked Allurements, his vicious ſuggeſtions could never take hold on us, would never find
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37273:43"/> Admittance into our ſouls, were not the way prepared for their Entrance by our evil Luſts and corrupt Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, thoſe Foes of our own Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; who like Treacherous falſe friends in a Beſieged Cittadel, ſet open the Gates thereof in time of Reſt and Security, for the Beſiegers to enter in at: Let us chiefly therefore have an obſervant eye over our own Hearts, endeavour our utmoſt to free them of all impurities, and beg of God that he would cleanſe the Thoughts, the Deſires of our Hearts, by the Inſpiration of his moſt Holy Spirit; and then we might bid ſafe Defiance to all the Devils wicked ſolicitations, to all the Worlds entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flatteries.</p>
               <p>We are apt to ſay of Smaller ſins, of ſins of humane Frailty and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of ſome Boſom Luſt, as <hi>Lot</hi> did of <hi>Zoar;</hi> is it not a Little one, and my Soul ſhall live? But ah how do we deceive our ſelves with ſuch vain
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37273:43"/> words! For can any Sin be Small, which is an offence againſt an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Great and Glorious Divine Majeſty? which is a violation of an Holy, Juſt, and Good Law? can any ſin be Small, the wages whereof is Death Eternal? The Price of whoſe Expiation was the precious Bloodſhed of the Son of God?</p>
               <p>The Diſtinction of ſins into Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Leſſer ones, is made not in regard that Leſſer ſins for their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are not Great ones in their Evil Quality; are not great Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the Divine Purity, highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God, equally expoſing of us with Greater Vices to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation, and to a ſuffering the vengeance of Eternal fire; but for that they are Leſſer breaches of the Eſtabliſhed Order and Harmony of things in this World, Offer Leſs violence to the checks of our Conſciences, are Leſs offences againſt the well-fare of our brethren, or ſmaller injuries to our own Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37273:44"/> Intereſts, whether of Mind or Body, of Goods, or Good-Name: However in ſtrictneſs of ſpeaking Small Sins are of a great Guilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more eaſily Reſiſtible, becauſe the Temptation to them is Lighter, and therefore a complyance with it, is an Evidence of great Degeneracy of Spirit, of an evil Heart within, which chooſes ſin with Little Bait in great meaſure for Sinnings ſake: The Weakneſs of Aſſaults from Leſſer Temptations, adds to the inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of our Cowardice, if we ſuffer them to vanquiſh us; and therefore they ought the more unyieldingly to be withſtood.</p>
               <p>This then being my Duty, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt all iniquity, againſt all Temptations, all Occaſions tending thereunto, I will by the Grace of God, be very diligent in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it: And dothou, O God, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then my Purpoſes, confirm my Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, Aſſiſt my ſincere Endeavours of Striving againſt ſin, of Reſiſting all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37273:44"/> its Allurements, of being brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of none of them: O Lord lead me not, permit me not to be led into Temptation, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from all evil, both Moral and Natural, Corporal and Spiritual; for thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>Meditation IX. Againſt the Sin of Murmuring and Impatience amidſt Divine Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</head>
               <p>IMpatience under Affliction is our puniſhment as well as Sin; it frets and corrodes the Mind, and thereby doubles upon us our ſufferings; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Body, that of the Spirit alſo: and moſt Juſt and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is it, that thoſe who refuſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to God's Government, ſhould be puniſh'd by their own perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Ah how fooliſh a Vice is Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with God's Diſpenſations of Providence toward us; it can in no wiſe make our Condition better, but will certainly render it much worſe, both on a Natural account, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37273:68"/> by Divine moſt juſt Ordination: For wriggling our Necks under the Yoke of Diſtreſs, is the ready way to make it ſit more heavy and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and Repining Diſcontent at the Chaſtiſements of Heaven, is ſo far from Relieving us of them, that they provoke God both to continue and Aggravate them upon us.</p>
               <p>Alaſs Man, how knoweſt Thou but thy Affliction is Deſign'd to thee in Mercy? but that 'tis the Greateſt Bleſſing can be beſtow'd upon thee? by keeping off the Greateſt Plague, Spiritual Sickneſs, Death, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! And canſt thou think it Reaſonable to Repine at thy Soul's Cure or preſervative in health? Canſt thou think it ſuitable to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at what may be thy higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Happineſs, thy Greateſt Matter of Rejoycing?</p>
               <p>God ſees thou canſt not be happy Eternally, and free from Temporal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37273:68"/> Affliction; and hadſt thou rather (imprudent Creature!) enjoy thy Good things here with <hi>Dives,</hi> than Reſt with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom? God foreſees that his Bleſſings of Earthly proſperity would be Real Curſes unto thee, by proving Diſ-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to thy Soul; and therefore is it, he in Compaſſion with-holds them.</p>
               <p>Thus he denies thee Temporal Riches, that thou may'ſt be Rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; Rich in Faith and Good Works: He with-holds from thee plenty of proviſion and fulneſs of Bread, leſt giving it thee, he might ſend Leanneſs withall into thy Soul; leſt being full thou might'ſt Deny him, and ſay who is the Lord? He finds poverty of Spirit, moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with thy poverty of Fortune; he finds thy Dependance upon him the more firmly Eſtabliſh't, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing to thee Day by Day his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Allowance. Does he deny
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37273:69"/> thee Health of Body and ſoundneſs of Conſtitution? Why he does it 'tis likely to a very Good purpoſe; that thy Soul may be the more healthy and Thriving in the Graces of his Spirit: in Humility, in Patience, in Contempt of the World, in Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Diſpoſals of his All-wiſe and Juſt, and Gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>A perſon who does not conſider 'tis in order to his future eaſe and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, will be apt to account his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons painful Launcing and laying open the Ill-affected part in his Body, a cruel unkindneſs unto him; but he who is mindful that all the Smart and Anguiſh he is put to is only in order to his ſubſuent Eaſe, and for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the unſound part to its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Conſtitution; This Man will be ready to Kiſs the hand that probes and cuts him, and will Thank his healer for dealing faithfully with him, though never ſo ſeverely.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:37273:69"/>
               <p>Yet ah the perverſeneſs which is in moſt of us! who wound our ſelves by ſinning, and then complain of the ſharp Inſtruments made uſe of for our Cure; who make our Souls Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with Iniquity, and then cry out againſt the bitter potion preſcribed us by God for our Recovery! Who provoke him by Diſ-obedience, and yet murmur under his Corrections for the ſame! But is this equal Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and Juſt dealing? Is it not the moſt unreaſonable? Ought it not on the contrary to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more; that which I ſee not, teach thou me; and lead me into the way Everlaſting, though through Briars and Thorns, though through many Tribulations.</p>
               <p>Alaſs that which heightens our Diſcontent with our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is our too intent poring on
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37273:70"/> the worſt ſide of our Condition; a pondering chiefly our Wants, our Sufferings, and Diſtreſſes; whereas did we but compare our Wants with our Poſſeſſions, our Calamities with our Enjoyments, we ſhould ſoon find the former if not out weighed with the latter, yet certainly much Alleviated by them: No man in my opinion is ſo miſerable, but he may meet with ſome cauſe or other of Comfort, and conſequently of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs that 'tis not worſe with him; Thus, did we but look Downward as well as Upwards amidſt our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I mean, did we but contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate what thoſe in a worſe condition than we, want and ſuffer; as well as what thoſe in a better, poſſeſs and enjoy; we ſhould if not Extreamly afflicted, find occaſion to turn our murmurings into Rejoycings, our Diſcontents into moſt peaceful Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:37273:70"/>
               <p>Fot what though Thou art in Need of ſeveral things which others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? Do but conſider how many perſons, perhaps better than thy ſelf, are in Need of much more, of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſaries; and then ſilence thy Repineings. What though thou ſuffereſt under great pain and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Ah do but meditate what more acute dolours and Diſtreſſes others feel, which Thou art freed from; and then ſee if thou haſt not more reaſon to praiſe God for his Goodneſs, than to fret againſt him for his Diſciplining Providence?</p>
               <p>Impatience is a moſt provoking ſin, and therefore a very unlikely Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Sufferings; it imports a Quarrelling with God for his Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards us; and conſequently a Rebellious Diſowning his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Right of Dominion over us: and is this ſort of behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Calamities a likely way to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

               <p>'TIS our Duty, and 'tis our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Priviledge; our Duty, we being commanded to Love him with all our hearts, ſouls, and ſtrengths; and our Intereſt, for what greater Love to our ſelves than to Love the fountain of all Lovelineſs? than to Love him, in whom are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd all thoſe Excellencies in infinite Degrees, which Scatteringly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly reſide in the Creatures, and yet render them Amiable and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired!</p>
               <p>Nothing is more Reaſonable alſo than to Love God, a being ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently Good in himſelf, ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Loving unto us; for to Him we owe all the powers of our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37273:76"/> Bodies, all the noble faculties of our Souls; all that we Are, all that we have comes Entirely from him; we ſhould be very ungrateful perſons ſhould we Love any thing ſo well as him, much more, ſhould we Love any thing Above him; for he hath not only created us, doth not only preſerve, and provide for us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as well as Neceſſaries; but he hath alſo dearly Redeem'd us from everlaſting Deſtruction, not with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, ſuch as Silver and Gold, but with no Leſs a Ranſom than the precious Bloodſhed of his Dear Son, God Co-equal with the Father: He hath likewiſe Sanctified us with the Regeneration of his bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thus hath God not only provided us all the Coveniences of this life, but alſo all things appertaining to a Better; has given us Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as well as Corporal; means of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37273:76"/> Grace, and hopes of Glory: So that He hath layd on us the Strongeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Love him, and if any thing elſe in the whole Creation is Lovely, much more Eminently ſo is the Divine Majeſty, who is owner of all his Creatures Lovelyneſs, and of Infinite more!</p>
               <p>If Beauty is an object of Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God the moſt beautiful Being, in whom dwells perfection of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs! If Riches are attractives of Eſteem and Valuation, behold the Deity the Treaſury of all Wealth, and of whatever is valuable! If plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is a thing Lovely and deſirable, behold in God's preſence Fullneſs of Joy, and at his Right hand pleaſures for Evermore!</p>
               <p>Sure I muſt hate my ſelf, if I Love not God; for therein conſiſts my Wellfare and Happyneſs! Shall I love other things, and not Him from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37273:77"/> whom they Borrowed their Lovely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Shall I Love the Stream, and not the Fountain of bleſſedneſs? What Joy do I deprive my ſelf of, if I Love not God? If I hate not all other things in compariſon of him? He that Loveth Father or Mother, ſayes our Bleſſed Saviour, more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that Loveth Son or Daughter, the moſt Near and Dear things, more than me; is not worthy of me. O who know the Enraviſhing Delights but thoſe who have experienced them, of Loving the Deity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloved by him! of holding ſuch Sweet Communion with the God of all Conſolation! It is a very Great Favour and Condeſcenſion that the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth will Admit of our imperfect Love, will Graciouſly Accept it; for 'tis imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, though never ſo Sincere; 'tis finite Love, though never ſo Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:37273:77"/>
               <p>What an inconceivable Honour is it to be vouchſafed the Loving our Creator! 'Tis certain we can have no better Object; no one ſo Good; the benefit of Loving God redounds wholly to our ſelves, not at all to him: However I will Love the Lord, not ſo much for my own Ends, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath Commanded my Love; as becauſe he is a ſupereminently Amiable Being, infinitely Deſerving my Love; as becauſe 'tis a Debt due from me a Dependant Creature, to my Maker and the Author of all my Enjoyments. I will Delight in Loving and Obeying him as long as I live, and I by his Grace will Evidence the Truth of my Love, by paying an Universal Reſpect unto all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

               <head>Meditation XI. On Zeal in the Service of God.</head>
               <p>HOW natural a Conſequent is this of the Love of God? Zeal to pleaſe him, Zeal to Reſemble him, Zeal to promote his Honour and Glory! Where, if not here, is Zeal Becoming? Where elſe can it be ſo Suitably placed? Nay, our Divine Services how can they well be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable without it? For where there is Sincerity of Intention in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Duty, (without which no Duty can be pleaſing to Heaven) we can ſcarce conceive Fervency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be wanting; unleſs through weakneſs and indiſpoſition of Body: And for the Service of God, (the moſt Glorious and Excellent of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) to be a cold and Languid Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37273:81"/> how Great an Abſurdity, how Great an Inconſiſtency is this? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Service of the Temple, the Sacrifice of the Altar, requires the flame and Fire of the Altar to render it of a ſweet-ſmelling Savour. To perform Duty to God with formality and indifferency of Spirit, is neither to conſider the Nature of the Work we are about, the Greatneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Divine Majeſty, nor yet what Earneſtneſs and Zeal the Care of our own Salvation exacts from us.</p>
               <p>The Love of God demands our whole heart, Soul and Strength; and conſequently the keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the Genuine Evidence of our Love, demands the utmoſt Exerciſe of our Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both bodily and Spiritual: That is not a Service of God which is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly diſcharged, but rather an Affront, rather a Contempt of him; 'Tis a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37273:81"/> doing ſomewhat in Religion to Still and Quiet the uneaſie Reproofs of our own Conſciences, but not doing any thing with a deſign of pleaſing God, out of Obedience and Love to his Commandments, or from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of becoming Like unto him in Holineſs: which Regards alone can conſecrate and render acceptable our Services.</p>
               <p>Zeal where is it due, if not in the Divine Worſhip? Than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is of greater Importance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of greater Worth, nothing more for our Intereſt and Advantage! Where the ſafety of our Immortal Souls, our Heaven and Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are concern'd, there certainly no warmth of Heart, no Diligence of endeavour can be too much.</p>
               <p>Ah did we but conſider God's Zeal, the ſounding of his Bowels, and tenderneſs of his Compaſſion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37273:82"/> toward us; we could not ſure want Zeal and Ardency of Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him!</p>
               <p>The holy Angels above who beſt underſtand the Value of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who know beſt how Exalted a pitch of Love and Duty an infinitely Good and Gracious Divine Majeſty merits at our hands, what a Pattern do They ſet us of Induſtry, Zeal, and joyful Alacrity in Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! And how does their intenſe and flaming Affection in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Shame and Reprove our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently? Can we ſerve either a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maſter, or a Better? One who Deſerves better our Services, or who is more willing and Able to Reward them plenteouſly?</p>
               <p>Do we pray thy Will be done on Earth as 'tis in Heaven, with a like Univerſality, Conſtancy, Fervour
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37273:82"/> and Chearfulneſs of holy Duty, and yet do we contradict this our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a partial, formal, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delightful Obedience? Have we that pious Reverence amidſt our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, which is anſwerable to the Great and Glorious Preſence of God, with whom in Prayer we have to do? Have we that importunity and Earneſtneſs of Supplication, that warmth and Zeal of Devout Addreſs, which is any way ſuitable to thoſe preſſing Indigencies we have to be ſupply'd? To thoſe burthenſome miſeries we have to be delivered from? Or does not coldneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of affection, wandering and diſtraction of thoughts, Dulneſs and wearineſs of mind mix with and deprave our Divine Worſhip? Ah how Little fervour of Spirit have we in ſerving the Lord! how Little of the true Spirit of Prayer, in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him!</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:37273:83"/>
               <p>Do not Gods Sabbaths, his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ordinances ſeem Tireſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us? A very Toil and Burthen does not his Eaſie Yoak of precept ſit Heavy on our Necks? And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>TRuſt and Relyance on God is our Duty and our Priviledge; 'tis our Duty as we were created frail, impotent, Neceſſitous Beings, and for that reaſon Confiding Dependant ones; as alſo God our Suſtainer is a Self-ſufficient and All ſufficient Store of Happyneſs, whoſe infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions render him an object of our Hope and Truſt proportionable to our greateſt Wants, of Ability to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or Relieve our moſt extream acuteſt Diſtreſſes. And what more Natural and Reaſonable than that we ſhould there place our Confidence and Relyance, where we have our Support and Dependance? But that we ſhould there found our Truſt,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37273:86"/> where we cannot be Diſappointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that a poor, helpleſs, diſtreſs'd Creature ſhould ſeek abroad for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and Relief? And where ſhould he Seek it ſo Suitably and Effectually as in God-Almighty? the fountain o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that this flying to God for Help and Succour, and repoſing all his Truſt and Confidence in the Deity, is the Confiding perſon's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and Advantage as well as bounden-Duty is evident; for what can give that Man inward Quiet and Tranquillity even in his beſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is ſubject every moment to the uncertainties and viciſſitudes of Human Affairs, to all the Dangers, all the Hazards, all the Actual Evils and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37273:86"/> Misfortunes of this mortal life, but a Relying Aſſurance that nothing can befall him beſide the wiſe Counſel, gracious Will and Ordination of that God in whom he puts his Truſt?

               <head>Meditation XIII. On the Fear of God.</head>
               <p>'TIS our Duty, and 'tis our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and happyneſs; fear the Lord all ye his Saints, there's the Duty; for there is no want to them that fear him, there is the Happyneſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 30. 9.</p>
               <p>We naturally fear any one we know will do us harm, or who has it in his power to do it; and ſure then we have juſt reaſon to fear God's Judgments for our ſins, who is able to do us more harme than all the world beſides; for he hath power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37273:91"/> he hath kill'd to caſt into Hell, to purſue us with his Vengeance into another ſtate; and he ever lives, as to Reward the Godly, ſo to puniſh Everlaſtingly the impenitent Sinner: And therefore our Saviour at the ſame time that he reproves our folly of fearing man, forewarnes us whom we ſhould fear, God Almighty; and he Reinforceth this his Exhortation, with a yea I ſay unto you, fear him.</p>
               <p>And who would not fear thee O Lord God of hoſts, and Reverence thy Name? For thou only art Holy; Thou only art to be feared: With Thee is power and Strength, with thee therefore ought to be Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fear.</p>
               <p>O who is ſo much an object of our fear as God? A mighty God, and Terrible! infinite in Juſtice, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Power, Awful in Omniſcience
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37273:92"/> and Omnipreſence! And who if we will nor fear him at preſent, ſo as to avoid Sin, will one day force us to fear him, when it ſhall be too Late to avoid Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now this fear of God to which we are obliged, is not ſo much a fear of him upon the account of his Exact Juſtice and Almighty power, as an Aweful Regard to him mixt with Love, and a warineſs of forfeiting his favour; 'Tis a fearing him for his very Goodneſs; that is, not only leſt we looſe our Share in it, but 'tis a letting his Eſſential Goodneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Communicated Goodneſs unto us, out of a principle of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Gratitude, be our Chief Motive and Obligation to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Caution, more than any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the Divine Puniſhments and Severities: 'Tis a fear of Looſing God's Love, more than of feeling the fore Effects of his Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:37273:92"/>
               <p>And hath this fear of the Lord poſſeſſion of our Souls? Do we fear him with a filial Reverential fear? More leſt we looſe our Intereſt in his Love and fatherly Affection, than for dread of incurring the ſeverities of his Juſtice, as our Judge and Puniſher? Does our Conſideration of his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold benefits conferr'd upon us, write in our hearts ſuch an ingenuous Law of Thankfulneſs, as that we fear him more out of a ſenſe of Gratitude for what we have Received of his Divine bleſſings, than for ſear of forfeiting thoſe which are yet in Reverſion?</p>
               <p>Ah 'tis this fear of Reverence, this fear of Diſpleaſing the Deity, this Holy Caution and Waryneſs, leſt we err from his Commandments, which is the true Godly-fear, the moſt Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in our Heavenly Fathers ſight with a fear of vengeance to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon them, the very Devils fear and tremble; but 'tis only a Son
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37273:93"/> of God, and Heir of Salvation, who fears God for his Goodneſs; fear of Divine Juſtice and Almighty Power is but the Beginning of Godly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the firſt ſtep in a profligate Sinners Converſion; but 'tis a fear of God made perfect by Love of him, a fear to offend him and looſe his friendſhip, which crowns the work of Regeneration, and ſhews our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in a ſtate of Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>O our God, Thou art Terrible as well as Lovely, but Thou art alſo Lovely in thy very Terrour; for therefore ſtand we in Awe of thee, leſt we ſhould forfeit thy good will and favour: O how will Love as well as Abhorrence create a Dread it us! a Dread of offending our Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: How will Gods Mercy as well as his Juſtice cauſe us to fear him! Oh that we may fear and Love him more; and ſo much the more fear
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37273:93"/> him, by how much we increaſed and abound in Love of him!</p>
               <p>And certainly 'tis our wiſeſt way on all accounts thus to fear God; for thy that fear the Lord, need fear nothing beſides! they having ſuch an Almighty Protector and Deliverer their Guardian: They need fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, and ſuch a fear as keeps them innocent from wilful offences, keeps them alſo calm and at peace in their own boſoms; preſerves them the Favourites of Heaven, and then they may defie all the Power and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Hell.</p>
               <p>The fear of any worldly thing will Leſſen mens fear of God, but their true fear of God will take from them all ſlaviſh fear of the World; the Lord is on our ſide, will they ſay, what need we fear what man can do unto us? The fierceneſs of man's anger againſt us God can turn both to His
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37273:94"/> and our Praiſe, in cauſing us patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear it; and the Reſidue of Wrath will be Reſtrain. Men can do us no more harme than God wil permit; but who can ſtop his Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> when he ſtretcheth it forth to take vengeance? He can ſuddenly change our Adverſaries evil minds toward us into thoughts of Love and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, of Peace and Good will; or at leaſt, I ſhould have ſaid at moſt for 'tis the Greateſt Bleſſing God can beſtow upon us; he can amply Reward our light afflictions which are but for a ſeaſon, with a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory!</p>
               <p>The fear of the Lord is our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Wealth and Riches as well as Safety and Protection; they that fear the Lord, both Corporal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings are theirs; pardon of ſin, healing of infirmities, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of God's Grace; whether things
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37273:94"/> preſent or things to come, all are Theirs; and they are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's: God is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lot of inheritance to all thoſe that ſtand in Awe of him, and ſin not; and in him being hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all the Treaſures of Goodneſs, He being the never-failing fountain of Happyneſs, thoſe conſequently who truely fear and have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Him, can never lack.</p>
               <p>If God is our Father, where is our Son-like Honour of him? If he is our Maſter, where is our Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fear?</p>
               <p>Ah who knows the power of Gods Wrath, who knows how Great an Object of Terrour he is, like the poor Diſconſolate and Deſpairing Sinner? in whom the Arrows of the Almighty ſtick faſt, and his hand preſſeth him ſore; againſt whom God writeth bitter things, and makes him to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37273:95"/> the iniquities of his Youth! Alaſe to ſuch a one God is fearful and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indeed; he believes God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgments, and believing that is, viewing them with a Senſible and more Lively proſpect he fear: and Trembles: For thereafter as a Man Fears, ſo is God's Diſpleaſure in his account; nay thereafter as a man Loves as well as Fears, God propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably Great is his Dread of looſing his favour; proportionably Grievous is his Sorrow upon Having loſt it: Hence we find Holy <hi>David</hi> crying out with bittereſt Complaints, Thou didſt hide thy face from me, O Lord, and I was ſore troubled; O turn thee unto me again, and have mercy upon me; caſt me not away from thy preſence, neither ſhut up thy Loving-kindneſs in Everlaſting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Such a Cutting Grief doth the loſs of the Light of God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance produce in thoſe who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Love him. This Love indeed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37273:95"/> caſteth out all Servile Deſpondent fear, which hath Torment, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth to Bondage; but it Quickens and improves a filial fear, ſuch as reſtraineth from offending: O may we fear God more leſt we forfeit his Love, than leſt we incur the ſevere penalties of his Diſpleaſure; may we fear him with a Reverential Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient fear as Sons, that we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear him with a burthenſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maying fear, as Slaves.</p>

               <head>Meditation XIV. On Love and Charity to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</head>
               <p>MUtual Love and Kindneſs is what the condition of our Nature dictates unto us; for man being born a Sociable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeable Creature, is for that very reaſon born an Amicable Loving one; for to what End and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould mankind Aſſociate and Live together, Converſe and hold Correſpondence, but to perform perform offices of Aid and Aſſiſtanc, of kindneſs and beneficence to each<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? the very Notion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37273:98"/> Acceptation of Humanity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Courteſie and Good-will, Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>We are born alſo calamitous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, neceſſitous Beings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mutually Dependant Creatures: and Dependance on each other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infers a reciprocal help and beneficience: For what more Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than that thoſe who by Nature are liable to ſtand in Need of other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when in want and Adverſity?</p>
               <p>'Tis the Prerogative of God alone to be Self-ſufficient and Independant and therefore God who ſaw every thing which he had made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold 'twas very Good, yet ſaw it not Good for man to be Alone, but reſolved on making an Help Meet for him; that they might be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comforting and Aſſiſtant to each other: Though in Paradiſe man
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37273:98"/> was much nearer Self-ſufficiency, and further Removed from helpleſsneſs than at preſent: So that both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, and the Ordination of God dictate, that we ought to be mutual helps and common Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to thoſe of our kind; as being our ſelves in the body, Subject to its wants and infirmities as well as other perſons.</p>
               <p>A further obligation to mutual Love and Beneficence ariſes from our being all very nearly Related, as Kinsfolks and brethren; as all caſt in the ſame mould, faſhion'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame General Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, partakers of the ſame blood, of the ſame common Humanity, nay of one very Subſtance, differenced only in ſome few Accidental Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances uneſſential to our Nature: And ought not now this neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Conſanguinity to make us Loving and Beneficent to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37273:99"/> without exception? Ought not the Cement of one blood, to unite us in one hearty Good will and Friendſhip? Should not Similitude and Likeneſs beget Love? Should not one common Nature produce in us one common Natural Affection? Cauſing us to love our ſelves in loving another, to do Good to our ſelves in doing Good to another; he being a part and member of our very Subſtance; fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone: And no man, ſays the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 5. 29. ever yet hated his own fleſh, but Loveth and Cheriſheth it, even as Chriſt the Church; and as we in conformity ought to Love and cheriſh one another.</p>
               <p>'Tis Natural even among Savage Beaſts for thoſe of the ſame kind to live at a Loving Agreement, and not to prey upon each other; and ſhall
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37273:99"/> Mankind whoſe very frame has Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs interwoven in it, be leſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable and Loving than Brute-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>Reaſon and Scripture, the Law of Equity, and that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and Chriſt, all urge acts of Kindneſs and Charity from this very Argument, <hi>Whatever you would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do unto them; Matth.</hi> 7. 12. You no doubt, were your Circumſtances ſuch as to be in Want and Diſtreſs, would that others ſhould Relieve you, have you therefore a ready will and Inclination to Relieve others, whoſe Wants and Neceſſities Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge your Relief: And ſince you know not, through the viciſſitude of Humane Affairs, and ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turn of Providence, but that the Now miſerable Condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may become your own ſome time hence; let the hazard of your
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37273:100"/> falling into want of Charity your ſeles, excite your Love and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence towards thoſe who are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally labouring under Penury and Affliction.</p>
               <p>Giving Relief to others is an eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the troubleſome Relentings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our own hearts, which muſt needs be touch'd and ſorrowfully affected at the ſight of a part of our own fleſh, of our common Nature being in Miſery and Diſtreſs; ſo that Love to others is the trueſt Love to our ſeles, it relieving us of that Grief and mental Diſquietude which a view of others wants and ſufferings excited in us.</p>
               <p>Nay the very Reflection on an act of Charity fills one with Joy and Delight, Refreſhes the Giver's mind, as much as the Almsdeed did the Receier's body; ſo that we the Benefactors are in ſome ſort behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37273:100"/> even to the Relieved, for their yielding us an occaſion of ſo great pleaſure and Contentment: For to Recollect how we have been the Almoners of Divine Providence in diſtributing to the Neceſſitous, how we have reſcued a poor miſerable man from Extremity of want, have Triumph'd over his miſery and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; and caus'd his refreſh'd Bowels in the very act of Relieving him to bleſs us, and his whole perſon to offer up Prayers and Good wiſhes on our behalfs; and how moreover we have made God hereby our Friend and Debtor, and have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and Gratified in doing Good the Supream Majeſty of Heaven and Earth: To Review all this after an Almſgiving, cannot but raiſe great complacency within us, and cauſe us to applaud our ſelves for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo Generous, ſo Godlike, and withall ſo pleaſing and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an action.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:37273:101"/>
               <p>Nothing will adminiſter to us ſo much Joy and Conſolation when Dying, nothing ſo much ſtrengthen us on a bed of Languiſhing, and make our bed in all our Sickneſs, as the Reflection how we have in our Life paſt through acts of Charity and Munificence made to our ſelves Friends of the Mammon of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, laid up to our ſelves Treaſures in Heaven, a place of the beſt Security, of the largeſt Intereſt and Improvement: How we have been Eyes to the blind, and Feet to the Lame, through our ſupporting Alms-deeds; how we have eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our Love to God, by Love to our Neighbour; loving him for God's ſake, and at his Injunction: How we have, like wiſe Merchants in a Foreign Country, Tranſmitted our Goods and Effects before us into that our Native Region, whither we
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37273:101"/> intend and expect ſhortly to Return our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Indeed I muſt Confeſs that Love to our very Enemies which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity enjoyns, has at firſt little of this pleaſure and Delight, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies doing Good to thoſe who never Diſ-obliged us; nay that 'tis an exceeding Irkſom and Difficult Duty, and that we are apt to cry out 'tis an hard Commandment, who can bear it? But beſides that Returning Good for Evil, Bleſſings for Curſings, Kindneſſes for Injuries, is the ready way to overcome our Adverſary's Enmity, and to convert it into a reciprocal Love and beneficence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; whereas a Retaliation of diſ-kindneſſes ſerves only to multiply, heighten, and perpetuate Quarrels, and oftentimes ends in the utter Ruine and deſtruction of both the contending Parties: Beſides this, if we would be Children of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37273:102"/> Father, perfect as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we muſt be Merciful even as he is Merciful, who is kind unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful and to the evil: Who as to his common favours makes no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their diſtribution, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Sun to ſhine, his Rain to deſcend on the Good and Bad, on the Juſt and Unjuſt perſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45.</p>
               <p>And oh how well does it Become us by heaping Coals of Love on our Adverſary's heads, to endeavour to melt them down into Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation! How well does it Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us the offended not only to forgive, but to be the firſt in ſuing for a mutual good Agreement with our offenders, whenas God himſelf by his Miniſters beſeeches Sinners to be Reconciled unto him! Whenas his holy Spirit ſtrives with our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, woes and importunes us by his Goſpel-Profers, and by his inward
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37273:102"/> Solicitations to give over our Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and accept of the terms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace and Pardon!</p>
               <p>Ah where is our Love to God, if we have little or none to our Brother, who bears his Image? Where is our Love to the Deity, if we obey not his Commandments? And this is one of his Commandments, that he who loves God, ſhould Love his brother alſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 21.</p>
               <p>How dwelleth he in Chriſt, and Chriſt, in him, in whom the Spirit of Chriſt, a Spirit of Love and Charity dwelleth not? How doth ſuch a Perſon do what in him lyes to defeat the Prayer of our Saviour, that we might be one as he and his Father are one, we one in Unity of Affection, as they are one in Unity of Divine Eſſence; who hates his Brother, or is at variance with him?</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:37273:103"/>
               <p>He is not a Chriſtian who hath no true Faith in Chriſt, and he hath no true Saving Faith, whoſe Faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not by Love, both towards God, and towards Man.</p>
               <p>Hath Chriſt thought thy Brother worth his Dying for, and doſt Thou Ungrateful Wretch think him not worth thy Living for, in all Offices of Love and Kindneſs towards him? Doſt thou conſider that thou art no further a Chriſtian than thou art Charitable; and yet profeſſeſt thou Chriſtianity and continueſt Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable? For Shame Man either Quit thy diſſembled profeſſion, or elſe Realize it by acts of Mercy and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
               <p>O what a pattern was Jeſus unto us of Love and Good-will, of Real Subſtantial Acts of Kindneſs! who went about doing Good, made it his chief buſineſs and Employment; healing all that were diſeas'd both in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37273:103"/> Soul and body: And who herein Recommended his Love, moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently Diſplayed and Illuſtrated it, in that while we were Enemies he Dyed for us; and ſhall not this move us to Live unto him in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all his Commandments, and particularly to That which he hath Dignified with a more peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, Calling it His, by way of Eminency above the reſt? This is My Commandment, ſays He, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye alſo Love one another, <hi>John</hi> 15. 12. And oh how can we well do otherwiſe, who have our Saviours ſo expreſly plain, ſo frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo preſſing and urgent Injunctions of this Duty; who have his ſo Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and Tranſcendent Example for it; who have the ſo potent Aids and Aſſiſtances of his Spirit of Love unto the performance! Ah can we deny any thing to the Lord who hath ſo Dearly bought and Redeemed us?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37273:104"/> Had it been ſome Hard thing that ſo Great a Benefactor had enjoyn'd us, would we not have done it? How much more when he bids us Love and be kind to one another? The moſt Eaſie, the moſt Delightſom of all Duties, would we but Try the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment!</p>
               <p>Ah ſhall we not do it? Shall not we Chriſtians who have one Faith, one Hope, one Baptiſme, one God and Father of us all, one Gracious Mediator and Redeemer; have alſo one Heart and Good-will to each other? Shall we who are Brethren, Heirs of the ſame hopes, of the ſame bleſſed promiſes, fall out and Quarrel by the way in our journying to our Home and Father's Houſe, upon the account of things indifferent and meer Trifles, if compar'd with the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion? Shall we violate Charity that moſt weighty Vital part of Chriſtianity, for meer Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37273:104"/> and Externals of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? of no worth in themſelves, but only as made Aſſiſtant to Piety and Devotion?</p>
               <p>What though we are not all of the ſame mind in matters un-eſſential to Religion, as indeed how ſhould we be, unleſs of the ſame ſize of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? Does however our Difference of Judgment lay on us any fatal Neceſſity to Differ alſo in Love and Affection? Though we are not all of one Mouth ſpeaking the ſame things, yet cannot we be all of one Heart? We ſhall never be of one mind, till in Heaven we behold things in one and the ſame Light, or at leaſt each of us in a Sufficient one; but we both may and ought to be of one Good-will on Earth. Ah that our Little Differences in opinion concerning Rites and Ceremonies, ſhould contribute more to our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than our General Agreement
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37273:105"/> in fundamental Doctrines (which we all acknowledge able to make us wiſe unto Salvation) does conduce to our Union and Coalition! While our Minds Agree in Chriſt in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of his Religion, let our Wills alſo be conjoyn'd; for what an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity is it, that we who are to live together in Heaven, if our Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs hinder not, ſhould live at variance here below?</p>
               <p>O Heavenly <hi>Samaritan,</hi> Thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſu, Prince of peace, Look down, Look down; behold here a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly torn and Divided Church; torn with Schiſme and Faction, fallen among Robbers and Spoilers, who moſt inhumanely have Entreated her; behold with a ſuccouring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion her bleeding wounds, which are as ſo many Mouths importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begging it: Pour thy ſuppling Oyl and Wine of Union into her Sores, bind up with the bond of Love
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37273:105"/> and Concord her broken and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted Members; Paſs not by on the other ſide of the way, as did the Relentleſs <hi>Levite,</hi> but let the Diſtreſs'd ſight of our miſery move thee to compaſſion, and thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion produce a Speedy Relieving us.</p>
               <p>Suppreſs in us, bleſſed Saviour, Entirely baniſh from us that Stingy Selfiſhneſs of Spirit, that narrow Confinement of Love to a Sect or Party which ſo much abounds in the Nation, and make us of a more publick Generous Temper, more Conſultive of the Good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity both in Church and State: And then the Spirit of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Unity ſhall dwell amongſt us; Love ſhall be our Guide, and Love ſhall be our Guard and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Love ſhall fit us for Heaven, and Love ſhall Conduct us thither: Nay Love ſhall bring down Heaven
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37273:106"/> upon Earth unto us; ſhall make us live in Peace, in Amity, in a Joyous Complacency at each others Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                  <p>O that the ſame mind may be in us which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who went about doing Good; healing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eas'd,

               <head>Meditation XV. On Improvement in Grace.</head>
               <p>THe Life of Grace is beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd by Growth therein; Spiritual Life no more than the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural one can ſubſiſt without Activity and progreſſive Motion; where-ever the ſeed of God is ſown in Truth and Reality, it will fructifie and become prolifick: In the School of Grace, as well as in that of Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not to Go forward and make improvement is to Go backward; and Vertue, like a tender young Plant, if it does not Thrive and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37273:109"/> Flouriſh, is in a Tendency to Decay and Wither.</p>
               <p>The ſlothful unprofitable Servant who did not improve his Talent, is in the Scripture-reckoning, in our Lord and Saviour's account nigh as bad, and as ſeverely puniſh'd, as the unjuſt Steward, who wickedly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzled it; and not to make uſe of Grace, is here reputed the ſame thing as not to have had it; To have it by Exerciſe and Improvement is judg'd by God the only true Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and he who has not the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is ſaid in Holy Writ only to ſeem to have them: And inſtead of encreaſing their Store, 'tis denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there that he ſhall looſe even thoſe meaſures of Divine Vertues which were once afforded him.</p>
               <p>Genuine Grace cannot ſtand at a ſtay; if it does not Aſcend and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37273:110"/> it infallibly Declines: And when God gives us this Talent to Trade withal and encreaſe it, ſhall we fruſtrate his End of Giving it by letting it lye Dead and unexerciſed? Did Chriſt purchaſe us the Graces of the holy Spirit, at the Dear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Rate of his own Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſhall we Neglect them when ſo purchaſed? Did He by his precious Death, and All-prevalent Interceſſion procure the Effuſion and ſending down of thoſe Graces, and ſhall we ſlight them when ſo ſent and beſtow'd on us?</p>
               <p>Ah what will not obſtinate Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sinning do! It will make us turn the bleſſed means of Grace into occaſions of Damnation; make what was intended towards us a Savour of Life unto Life, to become the Savour of Death unto Death; through our mad folly, and ſupine Negligence!</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:37273:110"/>
               <p>If we would but cooperate with Divine Grace, would but duely Exerciſe thoſe proportions of it we Already have, we ſhould ſoon find larger ones flowing in upon us from Above, and we ſhould have more Abundantly of God's Spirit; If we would but water and cultivate upon his implanting Gracious Diſpoſitions in our Souls, he would give Encreaſe to them, and perfect them into holy Habits; for former meaſures of Grace well comply'd with, fit and Qualifie us for further Succeeding ones; and the Sanctifying Light of the Holy-Ghoſt, like that of the Sun, ſhines in upon every Eye of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Underſtanding which will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Receive it.</p>
               <p>And therefore whenever we find a Good Motion in our Hearts, let us remember 'tis afforded us to improve that Good Diſpoſition into a vertuous
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37273:111"/> Act, and to Grow thereby in Grace; when-ever we find a check of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt Sin, a Reſtraining ſuggeſtion of God's Spirit, let us carry it on till we arrive to an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of that Vice; let us proceed from an hatred of it to a Reſolution of Amendment, and from that to an actual Endeavour againſt the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iniquity.</p>
               <p>We are accountable to God not only for that meaſure of Grace we have Receiv'd but alſo for further Degrees thereof, which had we well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed the preſent ones, we ſhould have been made partakers of; and therefore not only the miſ-uſing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Gifts we were poſſeſſors of, but likewiſe the hindrance by that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſage of God's beſtowing on us fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ones, will be charged upon us to our Condemnation, if we ſet not to the work and improve preſent Gracious intruſtments, And what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37273:111"/> ſhould hinder us from doing it? The Difficulty of ſuch an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Alaſs this is Leſſen'd by the Divine Aids proffer'd and which will certainly Aſſiſt us in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And what, I pray, can ſeem Grievous, when an Almighty power lends an helping hand to alleviate the Burthen?</p>
               <p>Ah it argues a weak and Low Meaſure of Grace to Covet after ſo much of Holineſs only, as will barely exempt us from Hell, and carry us to Heaven! Such a mean Spirited perſon in Religion, ſhews that Grace is not his deſire upon its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, upon its pure intrinſick worth, but meerly as it frees him from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine puniſhment; 'Tis not for Love of the former, ſo much as for fear of the Latter, that he would be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Holineſs at all: but ah how Little do they deſerve Eternal Glory, who are not deſirous of the moſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37273:112"/> Eſſential part thereof, Divine Grace, in an encreaſing Meaſure! Ah be there Different Degrees of Celeſtial Bleſſedneſs attainable, by different Degrees of Piety, and ſhall not this raiſe in us an holy Emulation, a Godly to Aim at Heroick Extraordinary Meaſures of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? At the very Higheſt procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?</p>
               <p>Let us conſider that the Longer the credited Loan of Grace remains in our Cuſtody unimproved, the Greater daily will Grow its Debt, and the more ample and enflamed the Reckoning which we ſhall at the End of all things be call'd to give in; and then to whom much was Given, of him ſhall much be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and whether we have put out our Talents of Grace to Uſury or no, yet Intereſt and Encreaſe of them will be demanded at our hands: It being that we ſhould have been
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:37273:112"/> buſied about the procuring, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have left it unprocur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Then at the Day of final Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts it will not be Enough to ſay, Lord, here is what is Thine, what thou committedſt to my Truſt; but where is the Improvement of it, where is the multiplying of it will be Enquired? O then reſt not Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with preſent Attainments, with weak unprogreſſive Meaſures of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, but forgetting the things in Religion which are behind, which are already arrived unto, let us preſs forward to the mark for the Prize of our high Calling in Chriſt; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring after the perfecting of Holineſs in God's Fear: And then He who is an overflowing Fountain of Grace and Goodneſs, and who communicates of it where ever he finds Subjects Capable of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, will cauſe us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

               <head>Meditation XVI. On DEATH.</head>
               <p>DEath! the very Thoughts, the very Name thereof, ſtrikes us with Horror and Affrightment! but alas the firſt Temporal Death, what is it if compared with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Eternal one? which is to be the ſad Portion of all finally impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners!</p>
               <p>Were the Temporal Death the End of all things with us, did it Determine and Annihilate our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it would be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming affrightful to the Wicked and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:37273:116"/> Impenitent, that they would rather gladly Welcome it, as the Reſcuer of them from what they moſt ſeared, a Penal Retribution for all their hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Provocations in this Life; but the Conſideration that the firſt Death is only an Inlet unto, a Beginning of the Second, which is never to have an End; Oh how muſt this prove doubly affrighting to the Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for the Temporal, and therefore obnoxious to the Eternal Death! both reluctant Nature and Guilt cauſing him to Dread it.</p>
               <p>The acute Dolours of an expiring Sinner's Body, make him Wiſh to Dye, but then the more torturing Terrors of his awaken'd Conſcience, urge him to retract thoſe Wiſhes, and to fear nothing more than a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will bring him to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eternal Condemnation; and thus the Dyeing Impenitent is rackt and tortured between contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37273:116"/> Deſires and Choices, the Guilty Agonies of his Mind pain him more than all the Convulſive Severities of his Diſeaſe; ſo that they Anticipate his Hell on Earth, and give him to feel ſome of its Torments, before he goes hence to Experience them in in the Groſs!</p>
               <p>But with the Righteous Godly Perſon it is not ſo; Death indeed to him may look at firſt ſomewhat affrightful, it being an abhorrence to Nature, a forcible Separation of Soul and Body, thoſe Dear Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but then being prepared for Death, he living in a continual pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Expectation of it, Faith, Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Confirming Faith, ſtrips in his ſight that King of Terrors of all his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:37273:117"/> of the Shadow of Death, and fear no Evil; Gives him a Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Proſpect beyond the Grave, Admoniſhes him to look forward to that Immortal Life, and Joy, and Glory ſet before him; and in fine, Repreſents to him a bleſſed Reunion of Soul and Body at the General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, never to part, never to be ſeparated again.</p>
               <p>Death to ſuch a one is as a Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Night of Repoſe after the hard Labour and Toil of the Day: They Reſt from their Labours, ſays the Scripture: 'Tis as the Enjoyment of the Promiſed Land, after a forty Years wearyſome Wandring in the Wilderneſs; nay, 'tis infinitely more; 'tis the Introduction into an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and Oh how Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt it be to have Shot the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37273:117"/> Wrecks and Dangers we have happily eſcaped, and to find our ſelves all on a ſuddain ſurrounded with New unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, unheard of, and before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Enraviſhments! Oh who would not Gladly Dye, to become Poſſeſſor of ſuch an Inheritance? who would not gladly Live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Mortification here, to be made Partaker of ſuch Infinite Delights in a Future State? Oh Our Life which we falſly ſo call, deſerves not ſo Good a Name; Our Life on Earth, is but a Death compared with the Eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs Above! They only Live, who being freed from the Fetters of the Body, from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Principles of Mortality, are out of a Capacity of Dying any more, and enjoy the utmoſt Delights, with a full Aſſurance of ever enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them!</p>
               <p>But here in the midſt of Life we are in Death; not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37273:118"/> but in an Actual Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; We draw in Vital Aire, only to breath it out again; and ſleep, the livelieſt Image of Death, is the beſt Repairer of our Life; by reaſon of which frequent Repairs, our Life ſeems no other than a ſucceſſive Living and Dying: Nay, our very Health, the height thereof what is it, but the next ſtep to a Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Sickneſs? many times an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe and Occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for when the Blood runs high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thence often proceeds a Feavour; and too Great a Quantity of Spirits may prove fatal, as well as the want of them: Juſt as an Houſe may fall oppreſt with too much bulk and weight, as well as through Weakneſs and Slightneſs of Building.</p>
               <p>Ah then that Men who live in continual Hazard of Dying, ſhould yet demean themſelves with ſuch careleſs Security, as if they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37273:118"/> to Live! Ah that upon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ought we know may De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our happy Eternity, and yet we ſquander away whole Days, and Years in Vanity! O when ſhall we become wiſe, and conſider profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly our Latter End? When ſhall we ſo number our periſhing days, as to apply our hearts unto Godly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Time paſſes on, though we mind it not, improve not its paſſing; Time paſſes on, and brings us every inſtant the nearer to Eternity: O how ought we to take care that it bring us to an Eternity of Bleſſedneſs: That the end of our Days prove to us the end of our Hopes, even the Salvation of our Souls!</p>
               <p>Alaſs what Vanity of Vanities, what meer Nothings at the hour of Death, will all things here below appear unto us, which Now look ſo charming, and take off our minds and endeavours from providing for
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37273:119"/> our happy Departures! How then will all our purſuits, all our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Honour, of Riches, and Pleaſure, appear as a Dream, as a vaniſhing Shadow; ſo that we ſhall at that time account the wiſdom of this world folly and madneſs; ſhall wiſh, wiſh Earneſtly that with all our other Gettings we had Gotten more Religious Underſtanding; had layd up larger Comfortable Treaſures of a good Conſcience, had been as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious for the Concerns of another Immortal Life, as for thoſe of this vain Tranſitory one!</p>
               <p>Let us therefore take Advice of Death in time of health; Death is a faithful Counſellor, and will not Deceive, will not flatter us; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis neceſſary for us to Dye one time or other, and as neceſſary unto Dying well, that we often meditate upon Death, let us make it the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37273:119"/> Subject of our thoughts, and in ſuch manner view things Now, as they will certainly appear to us at our near approach towards Death.</p>
               <p>O may we not live in ſuch a ſtate wherein we would be unwilling to be Surpriz'd by Death, unwilling to be call'd to Dye, before we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to any good purpoſe; but may we through the Spirit mortifie the Deeds of the Body, that we may be made Alive unto God; What we would wiſh were done when Dying, let us do that Good and vertuous work at preſent; and what wiſh were undone then, let us ſhun that wicked performance now; or if performed, undoe it by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before our latter End over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes us: So ſhall we be Ready for Dying, ſo ſhall the Day of our Deaths appear better to us than the day of our births; we coming into the

                  <p>O Holy Jeſu, thou Lord of Life and Glory, who by thy Death haſt overcome Death, and open'd unto us the Gate of Everlaſting Life, at the hour of Death, and in the Day of Judgment, Good Lord Deliver us; Grant that the End of our life on Earth, may be the Beginning to us of a bleſſed Eternity in Heaven; that the Second Death, the never-cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one may have no Dominion over us; but that when we diſcontinue Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with men, we may dwell with thee our God, and Converſe with all the bleſſed Society Above.</p>
                  <p>Grant, Heavenly Father, that when we come to lye on a Death-bed, we may

                  <p>We know, O Lord, that 'tis appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all men once to Dye, and that no one can reſcue his life from the pit of Deſtruction; and yet do we live as if we had made an Agreement with Hell, and had an unforfeitable Leaſe of our lives? O give us to Dye unto ſin Now, that we may ſleep in Chriſt at our Departure; and be Awaken'd, be Rais'd to life again in the Reſtitution of all things. Afford us ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing beams of the Light of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Countenance, when paſſing

                  <p>Be Thou preſent with us at the hour of Death O bleſſed Jeſu, who ſufferedſt Death for us upon the Croſs; by the vertue of that thy precious Death, Swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten we beſeech thee the bitterneſs of ours: When our Eyes ſhall be Darkned in the

One would have thought indeed that to be Deprived of Thy Sight, might have been puniſhment enough, without the Damneds En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in Hell-flames and tortures; but that beſides the mental Anguiſh for their Loſs of the Enjoyment of God, for their Loſs of Heavenly Joys unſpeakable, and full of Glory, they ſhould be tormented with the poſitive ſufferings of infernal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; ſhould be baniſh'd into fire, into fire Everlaſting, into fire Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prepared for the Devil and his Angels, the worſt of Company, the moſt Diſmal Society; Oh, how Doubly afflictive and vexatious muſt this prove unto them!</p>
               <p>We believe, O Lord, all this moſt ſolemne proceſs of a final Judgment, we believe and tremble thereat; O make it an ingenuous fear conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Souls: We behold with an Eye of faith this thy Judiciary Tryal
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37273:125"/> and Enquiry as clearly, as if it was the Object of our bodyly viſion; O Grant it may have ſuch an Effectual influence upon our hearts, as to make us live in continual Expectation of it; as if the laſt Trump were already ſounding in our Ears, and we ſaw the Graves open'd, the Dead coming forth, and the Divine Judge Seated on his Dreadful Tribunal!</p>
               <p>May our habitual mindfulneſs of this Day of future Reckoning, cauſe us to place a watch over our moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Thoughts, a Guard over our moſt Innocently pleaſant words, over our moſt conceal'd Retired actions; always remembring that God is about our path and our bed, and will bring every Secret thought and purpoſe of the heart into Judgment, with every Idle word, and moſt clandeſtine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:37273:126"/>
               <p>O the brightneſs of the Diſcoveries of that time of Tryal! How Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, how penetrating! No De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no Palliation, no Denyal, will that Day ſerve either to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or to cover our unrepented ſins; in vain will it be to offer at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excuſe or Concealment; the Darkneſs of hidden wickedneſs ſhall appear no Darkneſs at all, but ſhall be unto God as clear as the Noon-day.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall not a well-diſſembled Hypocriſie in Religion, any longer paſs for Sincerity, and the power of Godlineſs; then ſhall not habitually indulged vicious appetites and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions any longer paſs for pardonable humane Infirmities; a bare Negative holyneſs, the not having done any Enormous evil, ſhall not then Satisfie for the want of Real Poſitive piety, for the want of having done all the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37273:126"/> Good we could; neither ſhall bare Deſires after Grace, without the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Endeavours, be reputed Grace it ſelf: But all falſe Diſguiſes ſhall be taken off from both our ſelves and others, and a Man ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted only for that he Really hath of Vertue and Goodneſs, not for that which he ſeem'd to have of it in this World, but truely had not.</p>
               <p>The Juſt ſhall then be Hardly found Juſt; the Righteous ſhall Scarcely be Saved; O where then ſhall the Sinner and Ungodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? How ſhall they Stand, as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, when Judged?</p>
               <p>O may we in ſerious thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereon, fancy our ſelves before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt; may we Examine our ſelves whether we are Ready prepared for the giving up our Accounts? Whether our Lives are able to bear a ſtrict Scrutiny at
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37273:127"/> the Day of our Judges Appearance? What holy work we would then more eſpecially deſire to be found Eminent in? And that let us Now more peculiarly be buſied about; what it is we would then be moſt Aſhamed of, and wiſh it had never been acted, or ſincerely Repented of? And that let us Repent of Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in this our ſeaſon of Grace and Salvation: May we think no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pains too Great, no Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyals too ſevere, no Addreſſes to Heaven too frequent or too fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to render us provided for our future Tryals; but may we enter at preſent into Judgment with our ſelves, Accuſing and Condemning our own ways, that when we ſhall appear before the Great Judge, he may find that before-hand we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and Judged.</p>
               <p>Let us often meditate, Lord who can Stand before Thee when Thou
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37273:127"/> art Angry? Who can be cleared when judged, ſhouldſt not thou in the midſt of Judgment remember Mercy? Woe were it to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent unblameable Life, if Thou O God, laying aſide thy Clemency, ſhouldſt ſift and Judge it Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.!</p>

               <head>Meditation XX. On Prayer, and the Powerful Efficacy thereof.</head>
               <p>PRAYER, 'tis a Duty of Natural Religion and Worſhip; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation thereunto being founded in the Eternal and immutable Reaſon of things: In God's Supereminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections, and in our own Dependent Indigent Condition as Creatures.</p>
               <p>We are born infirm and weak, poor and Neceſſitous Beings, in Condition Alms-People and Beggars; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pray alwayes is a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:37273:146"/> on us from the ſtate of our Nature, as well as by the Command and Enjunction of God-Allmighty.</p>
               <p>Prayer, 'tis an Acknowledgemant of God's Awful Tranſcendent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and of our own deſpicable meanneſs and imperfection; of his Sovereignty, and our Subjection; of his Self-ſufficiency and over-flowing plenitude of Happyneſs, and of our own penury, ſtraightneſs of fortune and impotency; of his immaculate Purity and Holyneſs, and of our Vileneſs and Corruption by Reaſon of ſinning: And upon theſe Accounts our Addreſſes to Heaven ought to be accompanyed with all Lowlyneſs and Humality, with all holy Dread and Reverence.</p>
               <p>Prayer being alſo a Duty of the greateſt Importance to us, an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bringing down all manner of Bleſſings, Temporal, Spiritual, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:37273:147"/> Eternal, ought to be offer'd up with the moſt fixt Attention of mind, with the moſt zealous Intention and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Spirit; with the moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sorrow in Confeſſion, the moſt Earneſt Deſires in Petition, the moſt urgent and yet Lowly importunity in Deprecation, with the moſt Rais'd Joy and affectionate Gratitude in Thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>We ought alſo in Prayer to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe an unſhaken Faith, Hope, Truſt, and Confidence; but however to wait with Patience and Dependance, with an humble Submiſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to God's will, whether or no he ſhall be pleas'd to Gratifie the Deſires of our hearts, to Anſwer the requeſts of our lips.</p>
               <p>And to induce us with the greater Willingneſs and Alacrity to ſet about this Duty of Prayer, let us conſider the mighty Honour and high Dignity
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:37273:147"/> accuring to us therefrom; for is it not an Honour for us Creatures to be permitted to talk and freely converſe with our Creator? Is it not an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for us vile worms, for us ſinful Duſt and Aſhes, to be allow'd the priviledge of having ready Acceſs at any time to the Supream Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, thereby to make known to him our ſins, our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our wants, our calamities and diſtreſſes, and hereupon to obtain the pardon of our ſins, the healing of our infirmities, the Supply of our preſſing wants, the mitigation, or entire Removal of our Diſtreſſes?</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo the ineſtimable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Prayer; 'tis the Channel through which are convey'd all our Mercyes, the beſt Deſenſative againſt impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Dangers and miſchiefs, againſt Divine Judgments and corrections for ſinning: The great Repeller of Temptations, the powerful Subduer
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:37273:148"/> of our vices and evil inclinations, the fruitful improver of our Graces and vertuous Diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider together with the Honour and Benefit the great Delight and pleaſure reſulting from a due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Prayer; for what can be more pleaſurable than to maintain a conſtant Intercourſe with the Higheſt and moſt Excellent of Beings? Than to hold Communion by Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace, with our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Preſerver, Redeemer, Sanctifier, and Continual Benefactor; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to have the frequent Effects and Emanations of his Goodneſs and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity derived down upon us, and the Devotional Teſtimonies of our Love and Gratitude Aſcending up again unto him? What can be a greater Eaſe and Refreſhing to our minds, than to Disburthen them of the oppreſſive weight of Guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by a free and ingenuous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:37273:148"/> thereof, by humble petitioning for forgiveneſs of the ſame, by Deprecation of puniſhment, and reſolutely promiſing by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's Grace, never to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the like, or any other wilful wickedneſs for the future? In ſine, what more Delightful than to vent our Griefs, our fears, our wants, our Anxieties, and Diſtreſſes into the Ears of our Heavenly Father, one ſo Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Affectionate, ſo True to his word, ſo mindful of his promiſes, ſo Large in Bounty and beneficence; ſo thoroughly Able, ſo exceedingly Willing to ſupply all our wants, to Dry up all our Tears, to Remove all our Affrightments, to Satisfie our Anxieties, and Relieve our ſoreſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes?</p>
               <p>Prayer rightly circumſtantiated what is't it cannot do? It has ſubdued Kingdoms, obtain'd promiſes, wrought Miracles, Stopt the Mouths of Lions,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:37273:149"/> Quench'd the violence of fire, out of weakneſs made Men Strong, Rais'd the Dead to Life again: It makes at preſent through the meritorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of our Saviour, peace both in Heaven and Earth; unlocks the Gates of Divine Mercy, rifles the Celeſtial Treaſury, brings down much of its rich Stores unto us; has power both with God and Man, and mightily prevails; Rendring both yielding, entreatable, compaſſionate!</p>
               <p>Prayer, 'tis another <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, which maintains a mutual Commerce and Correſpondency between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; 'tis a Burning-Glaſs of Divine Love, wherein all the heats and warmths of a ſervently pious Soul are concenter'd; wherein it exerciſeth all its Grace with the greateſt vigour and Activity: Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth its profoundeſt Humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, its firmeſt Dependance on him for Supplies and Belief, its

               <p>And of all the parts of Prayer, none more Noble and Generous, none more endearing and Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God, becauſe none more Diſintereſted and unmercenary, than Praiſe and Thankſgiving: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition reſpects Good things to come which we ſtand in Need of; Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Regards the keeping off, or Removal of thoſe Evils which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our Sins have righteouſly deſerved; and therefore Self-Intereſt as well as Religious Inclination put us upon the frequent uſe of theſe parts of Prayer; but Praiſe reſpecting
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:37273:150"/> purely an Admiration and awful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling of the Divine perfections, and Thankſgiving being the making a Grateful Return to God for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold favours and Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes paſt and Gone, Praiſe and Thankſgiving are hereupon the more undeſigning, the more free and unſelfiſh acts of Devotion; and conſequently the more valuable and worthy in themſelves, the more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and well-pleaſing to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And indeed what more Juſt and Reaſonable, what more becoming and Suitable, as well as Joyous and Delightſome a thing, than to be Thankful for Divine bleſſings recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Ah ſince the whole World is but one large Store-houſe, one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine and Treaſury of Heavenly Love and beneficence, how ought the World hereupon to be one large Temple, one Univerſal Quire of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:37273:150"/> Praiſes and Hallelujahs! Of Thankſgivings as Zealous, Fervent, and Affectionate, as the Divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions which we enjoy, are Great, Prizable, and Important! How ought our fire of Devotion to be like that of the Veſtal Virgins, perpetual and unexpiring! How ought the Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Embers of an habitually Grateful Temper and diſpoſition to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept alive upon our hearts, though they are not ever actually breaking forth into a flame!</p>
               <p>And indeed Prayer let it have never ſo much LIght, never ſo much Quickneſs of thought, and Luſtre of Expreſſion, yet if it have not alſo warmth and Zeal of Affection, 'tis but as the Glimmerings of a Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme, or like thoſe Shining Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which make Men believe they are Safe Conducted, when they are leading all the while into Bogs and Rivers, into peril and Deſtruction.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:37273:151"/>
               <p>Devotion if it has not the fire of the Altar, will never prove the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Altar, ſuch a Sacrifice wherewith God is well-pleaſed; for 'tis the fervent Prayer alone which is Effectual, and unleſs Effectual, 'tis of no Value and Advantage: But the fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man Availeth much; it pierceth the very Clouds, Enters into God's Preſence, beſieges his Throne and Mercy-Seat, and will not turn away, will not give over its Solliciting, till ſuch time as the Almighty hears and gives an Anſwer, either by a Grant of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or by as kind and obliging a Denyal!</p>
               <p>Importunity at the Throne of Grace, in the Court of Heaven, is not there accounted Troubleſomneſs and Impertinency, Clamour and Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manners, as 'tis in Earthly Courts; but Heaven willingly ſuffers violence, the force and power of Devotion is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:37273:151"/> Delightſome unto it, and the violent importunate Supplicants are thoſe only who take it by force.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled all night in Prayer with God, the Angel of the Covenant, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus, Such was his Prayers prevalency, Such its holy and Spiritual Charms, that Almighty God could not or would not free himſelf from them, till ſuch time as <hi>Jacob</hi> ceaſing his Prayer, let him Go and Diſmiſt him! <hi>Gen</hi> 32. from 24, to 29. <hi>ver.</hi>

What do we mean by offering this Sacrifice of the Altar, if the flame and fire of the Altar a Zealous Devotion be wanting in us? Ah better were it we were otherwiſe employ'd, if while we now draw near to thee with our

How often Reſiſted the holy motions, the Reſtraints of thy bleſſed Spirit! How long negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Great Salvation of thy Goſpel! How many times violated our moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant!</p>
                  <p>The very Multitude of our ſins is Enough to Amaze and Affrighten us, to cover us with Shame and Confuſion of face; but the Heinouſneſs, the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                  <p>O our God, Strong and patient, hadſt thou not been God, how couldſt thou have had patience with ſuch perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, ſuch ungrateful, ſuch willfully Diſobedient Rebells! Well for us is it, that thy mercy and forbearance Exceed that of Man, are like the ſelf, unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!

                  <p>And not meerly for the Pardon of our ſins implore we mercy at thy hands, but for a Divine power to enable us to ſubdue them; Set we beſeech thee, O Lord, our hearts in ſuch a perfect Enmity againſt all things contrary to thy bleſſed Will and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we may never be Reconciled to them any more; diſpoſe us to ſuch an Entire Affection to thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may become our Choice, our Deſire, our Exceeding Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing!

                  <p>Fill us, Gracious God, with the whole Knowledge of thy Will in all Wiſdom and Spiritual Underſtanding, and Aſſiſt us with thy Grace unto the Conſcientious practice of ſuch knowledge; Increaſe in us that faith which worketh by Divine

                  <p>Keep us, O Lord, pure and unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the World; Temperate, Chaſte, and Unſpotted with the fleſh; keep us Safe and unſeduced by our own hearts luſts, by Satans wicked Suggeſtions and Allurements; Cauſe us to have our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation without Covetouſneſs, to have it more in Heaven, leſs on Earth; teach us contempt of Earthly things; teach us to deny our ſelves, to conquer all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to live above the corruptions which ſo much abound in the Age: Give us Patience, give us ſupporting comfort, and quiet ſubmiſſion in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;

                  <p>Waſh his Soul clean, O God, in Chriſt's moſt Precious Blood; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him more and more to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctrine and Example of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed Jeſus; Sanctifie him with all the Saving Graces of thy Renewing Spirit: Give him, if it be thy Will, ſome Delightful Foretaſtes and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations of Celeſtial Bleſſedneſs; Hope towards Thee, an Enraviſht Senſe of thy Favour, Joys in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, unſpeakable and full of Approaching Glories: However, if
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:37273:177"/> this be too great a Vouchſafement, make him at leaſt Willing to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, Fit for Heaven, Full of his Saviour, Empty of himſelf, and of all Truſt in his own Defective Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and whenever thou takeſt him out of this World, take him we Beſeech Thee unto thy ſelf into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Felicity, <hi>Amen,</hi> Holy Jeſu, for thy Precious Death and Paſſions ſake,</p>
